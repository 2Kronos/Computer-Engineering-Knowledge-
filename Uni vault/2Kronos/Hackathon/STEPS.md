---

### **Step 1: Implement CRUD Operations (Day 1â€“4)**
1. **Backend:**
   - Create Spring Boot endpoints for Employees, Projects, and Mappings.
   - Implement CRUD operations for Employees and Projects.
   - Connect the backend to the database.
2. **Frontend:**
   - Build Angular components for managing Employees, Projects, and Mappings.
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend API.

---

### **Step 2: Build the AI-Powered Chatbot (Day 5â€“8)**
1. **Integrate OpenAI API:**
   - Use LangChain to create an AI agent.
   - Implement logic to answer questions like:
     - Hours spent on a project
     - Employee start dates
     - Hours worked in the past month
2. **Create a Chat Interface:**

   - Fill missing mappings based on logical work schedules.
   - Use AI to suggest optimal project assignments.

---

### **Step 4: Ensure Responsiveness and User Experience (Day 11â€“12)**
1. **UI Enhancements:**
   - Use Angular Material or Bootstrap to make the UI responsive and user-friendly.
   - Test the application on different devices.
