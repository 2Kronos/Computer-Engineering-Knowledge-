### **Solaris Synchronization**
- **Locks for Multitasking**: Solaris supports various locks to handle multitasking, multithreading, and multiprocessing, including real-time threads.
- **Adaptive Mutexes**:
  - Start as semaphore spin-locks for efficiency in protecting data from short code segments.
  - If the lock is held by a thread on another CPU, it spins.
  - If the lock is held by a non-running thread, it blocks and sleeps until signaled.
- **Condition Variables**: Used for thread synchronization.
- **Readers-Writers Locks**: Used for longer code sections accessing shared data.
- **Turnstiles**: Manage the order of threads waiting for a lock, specific to the lock-holding thread (not per object).
- **Priority-Inheritance**: Threads waiting in a turnstile inherit the highest priority of any thread in the turnstile to avoid priority inversion.

### **Windows Synchronization**
- **Interrupt Masks**: Used on uniprocessor systems to protect global resources.
- **Spinlocks on Multiprocessor Systems**: These locks prevent preemption of the spinning thread.
- **Dispatcher Objects**:
  - Act as mutexes, semaphores, events, and timers.
  - **Events**: Function similarly to condition variables.
  - **Timers**: Notify threads when time expires.
  - **Signaled and Non-Signaled States**: Dispatcher objects are in a signaled state when available, and non-signaled when threads are blocked.

### **Linux Synchronization**
- **Kernel Versions**:
  - Prior to version 2.6, Linux disabled interrupts to implement short critical sections.
  - Version 2.6 and later supports full preemption.
- **Synchronization Tools**:
  - **Semaphores**, **atomic integers**, **spinlocks**, and **reader-writer versions** of these are available.
  - **Single-CPU Systems**: On single-CPU systems, spinlocks are replaced by enabling and disabling kernel preemption.

### **Pthreads Synchronization**
- **Pthreads API**: OS-independent API for thread synchronization.
- **Provided Features**:
  - **Mutex Locks** and **Condition Variables**.
- **Non-Portable Extensions**:
  - Includes **read-write locks** and **spinlocks** for more specific use cases.

### **Alternative Approaches**

#### **Transactional Memory**
- **Concept**: A sequence of read-write operations executed atomically, ensuring no interference from other processes.

#### **OpenMP**
- **Definition**: A set of compiler directives for parallel programming, using constructs like `#pragma omp critical` to ensure atomic execution of critical sections.

#### **Functional Programming Languages**
- **State Management**: Variables are immutable and cannot change once assigned, reducing the risk of data races.
- **Examples**: Erlang and Scala are popular for handling concurrent programming safely.
