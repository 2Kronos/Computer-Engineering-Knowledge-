### **Bounded-Buffer Problem**:
- **Buffers**: A fixed number of buffers (n) that each hold one item.
- **Semaphores**:
  - **Mutex**: Controls mutual exclusion, initialized to 1.
  - **Full**: Keeps track of filled buffers, initialized to 0.
  - **Empty**: Keeps track of available buffers, initialized to n.

- **Producer Process**:
  - Produces an item and places it in the buffer, while ensuring synchronization using semaphores.

- **Consumer Process**:
  - Removes an item from the buffer and consumes it, with synchronization to ensure no conflicts.

### **Readers-Writers Problem**:
- **Shared Data**: A dataset shared by multiple processes.
  - **Readers**: Only read the data, do not modify it.
  - **Writers**: Can both read and write to the data.

- **Synchronization**:
  - Multiple readers can access the data simultaneously.
  - Only one writer can access the data at a time, blocking others.

- **Semaphores**:
  - **rw_mutex**: Controls access for readers and writers, initialized to 1.
  - **mutex**: Ensures mutual exclusion for the read count, initialized to 1.
  - **read_count**: Tracks the number of active readers, initialized to 0.

- **Writer Process**:
  - A writer waits for access to the shared data, performs writing, and releases the lock.

- **Reader Process**:
  - Readers increment the read count and gain access to the data.
  - When the first reader arrives, it blocks writers. When the last reader finishes, it releases the lock, allowing writers to proceed.

### **Readers-Writers Problem Variations**:
- **First Variation**: Readers are not blocked unless a writer has permission to use the data.
- **Second Variation**: When a writer is ready, it performs the write operation as soon as possible.
- Both variations may lead to starvation, prompting further variations in implementation.

- **Solution**: Some systems solve this with a **reader-writer lo
