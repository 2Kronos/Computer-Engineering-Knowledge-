Wrote Software Design test 2 and it was the worst experience ever

- I was not able to code 
- I was utterly useless
- My skill as an engineer were non existent. 
-
## What I learned

- I dont know how to work with arrays, methods, regular exprssion, writing to a file
- I did not know how to use the random class
- I panicked alot
- Lack of information made the task look greater than it is.
- The study schedule is a top priority and I need to stick to it


## PLAN  AHEAD

## Practice alot
