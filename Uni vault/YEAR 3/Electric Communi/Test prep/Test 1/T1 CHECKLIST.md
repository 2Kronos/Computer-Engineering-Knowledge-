	- [x] 1.1.2When should you determine the gain 
	      
- [x] 1.2 When to use instruments (Ammeter, Voltmeter, Multimeter, Wattmeter).
      
- [x] 1.3 Under condition will we use multiple of these instruments
	- [x] 1.3.1. Benefits of using multiple instrument
	- [x] 1.3.1. Benefits of using single instrument 
	      
- [x] 1.4 Calculate gain using dBm, dBW, and dB values.
	
- [x] 1.5 Derive gain while considering resistance for output and input power.
      
- [x] 1.6 Explain how resistance affects gain calculations.
- "Gain in electronic communication systems can decrease over time due to resistance changes influenced by temperature variations, aging components, and power fluctuations."
- "Maintaining stable temperature conditions in transistor-based communication systems helps **reduce thermal noise and component degradation**, ensuring stable performance."
## ✅ 2. Modulation
- [x] 2.1 Explain and describe modulation.
	- [x] 2.1.1 Mention different types (AM & FM)
	- 7-9 sentences 
	- When you see the word identify just list the answers
	  
- [x] 2.2 Calculate upper sideband and lower sideband in amplitude modulation (AM).
	- [x] 2.2.1 Be able to draw all the Band diagrams 
	      
- [x] 2.3 Identify, describe, and present diagrams for all AM variants.
      
- [x] 2.4 Classify AM variants based on bandwidth efficiency and power efficiency.
      
- [x] 2.5 Calculate the transmit power for  all the variants given different system parameters 
      
- [x] 2.6 Understand trade-offs in choosing different AM variants.

## ✅ 3. Frequency Modulation (FM) and Amplifiers
- [ ] 3.1 Understand the significance and impact of the modulation index in AM and FM.
	- [ ] 3.1.1 What are they roles in the broadcast system of each AM and FM 
	      
- [ ] 3.2 Explain the benefits of frequency modulation over amplitude modulation.
	- FM has better signal quality 
	- Reduce noise susceptibility in comparison to AM 
	  
- [ ] 3.3 Understand non-linearity and linearity in amplifiers with respect to amplifiers (Different classes.
	- Non-linearity occurs when an amplifier operates outside its linear region, typically when moving between active, cut-off, and saturation modes.
	- Distortion arises when signals are clipped or modulated non-linearly, often seen in overdriven amplifiers or low conduction angle designs.
	- Lower conduction angles (Class C amplifiers) improve efficiency but introduce harmonic distortion.
	- Class A amplifiers are the most linear but inefficient, while Class B and AB offer a balance between efficiency and linearity.
	  
- [ ] 3.4 Compute and explain the impact of the Q factor for frequency selective components.
- [ ] 3.5 describe the role and function of frequency selective components in communication systems.
