# Test 1 Preparation Checklist

## ✅ Gain – Measurement and Calculation
- [ ] Understand how to measure gain in a broadcast system.
	- [x] Why is it important to measure it.
	- [x] When should you determine the gain 
	      
- [ ] When to use instruments (Ammeter, Voltmeter, Multimeter, Wattmeter).
      
- [ ] Under condition will we use multiple of these instruments
	- [ ] Benefits of using multiple instrument
	- [ ] Benefits of using single instrument 
	      
- [ ] Calculate gain using dBm, dBW, and dB values.
      
- [ ] Derive gain while considering resistance for output and input power.
      
- [ ] Explain how resistance affects gain calculations.
- "Gain in electronic communication systems can decrease over time due to resistance changes influenced by temperature variations, aging components, and power fluctuations."
- "Maintaining stable temperature conditions in transistor-based communication systems helps **reduce thermal noise and component degradation**, ensuring stable performance."
## ✅ Modulation
- [ ] Explain and describe modulation.
	- [ ] Mention different types (AM & FM)
	- 7-9 sentences 
	- When you see the word identify just list the answers
	  
- [ ] Calculate upper sideband and lower sideband in amplitude modulation (AM).
	- [ ] Be able to draw all the Band diagrams 
	      
- [ ] Identify, describe, and present diagrams for all AM variants.
      
- [ ] Classify AM variants based on bandwidth efficiency and power efficiency.
      
- [ ] Calculate the transmit power for  all the variants given different system parameters 
      
- [ ] Understand trade-offs in choosing different AM variants.

## ✅ Frequency Modulation (FM) and Amplifiers
- [ ] Understand the significance and impact of the modulation index in AM and FM.
	- [ ] What are they roles in the broadcast system 
	      
- [ ] Explain the benefits of frequency modulation over amplitude modulation.
	- FM has better signal quality 
	- Reduce noise susceptibility in comparison to AM 
	  
- [ ] Understand non-linearity and linearity in amplifiers with respect to amplifiers (Different classes.
	- Non-linearity occurs when an amplifier operates outside its linear region, typically when moving between active, cut-off, and saturation modes.
	- Distortion arises when signals are clipped or modulated non-linearly, often seen in overdriven amplifiers or low conduction angle designs.
	- Lower conduction angles (Class C amplifiers) improve efficiency but introduce harmonic distortion.
	- Class A amplifiers are the most linear but inefficient, while Class B and AB offer a balance between efficiency and linearity.
	  
- [ ] Compute and explain the impact of the Q factor for frequency selective components.
- [ ] describe the role and function of frequency selective components in communication systems.
