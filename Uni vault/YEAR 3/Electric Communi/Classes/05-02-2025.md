# What is it 

- There are three key properties of a sine wave that can be changed:
    - **Frequency**
    - **Phase**
    - **Amplitude**
- **Amplitude Modulation (AM)** conveys information by varying the **amplitude** of the carrier wave.

### How are they created

![[Pasted image 20250219001139.png]]

- **AM signals** are created using a **mixer**.
- The **inputs** to the mixer:
    - An **unmodulated RF carrier**
    - A **low-frequency modulating signal**
- The **output** is a **modulated RF carrier** whose **time-domain envelope** is a copy of the **modulating signal**.









- Our signal waveform must be modified so it can travel a long distance
- How to enusure that we can travle a long distance we have to modulate
- When we  modulate we impose our signal on the carrier wave

$$ e_c = E_c SinW_c t$$
$$ e_i = E_i SinW_c t$$

Mixing occurs like 
$$ e_c \times e_i = E_c SinW_ct \times  E_i SinW_c t $$

Fusb = upper sideband frequency
Flsb = lower sideband frequency 

$$f_{usb} = f_i +f_c$$
$$f_{lsb} = f_c +f_i$$

$$P_sb = \frac{M^2}{4} \times P_c$$
