## Power and Information Transmission 

- decibels db - efficient way to determine the output for a given input

- The `power derived dB expression` 
	requires knowing the output and input power
	Measured with wattmeter
	
- The `Volatge-derived dB expression` 
	Requires knowing input and output power 
	
- Power values used in communication system are give in dBm/dBmW 
	- These ratio are computed with a input reference power of 1mW or 1W

$$A_{dBM} = 10\ log_{10}\ \frac{P_2}{1mw}$$
$$A_{dBW} = 10\ log_{10}\ \frac{P_2}{1W}$$

### The Decibel as a Voltage or current Ratio

- Decibel can be thought of as  a power ratio
- Voltage and current can be expressed as a decibel relationship provided that input and output impedance/ resistance are taken into account
- $P= \frac{V^2}{R}$ one can substitute as follows into the power relationship

$$10\ log\ \frac{P_2}{1W} =\ X$$
# Amplitude Modulation

- Our signal waveform must be modified so it can travel a long distance
- How to enusure that we can travle a long distance we have to modulate
- When we  modulate we impose our signal on the carrier wave

$$ e_c = E_c SinW_c t$$
$$ e_i = E_i SinW_c t$$

Mixing occurs like 
$$ e_c \times e_i = E_c SinW_ct \times  E_i SinW_c t $$

Fusb = upper sideband frequency
Flsb = lower sideband frequency 

$$f_{usb} = f_i +f_c$$
$$f_{lsb} = f_c +f_i$$

$$P_sb = \frac{M^2}{4} \times P_c$$
