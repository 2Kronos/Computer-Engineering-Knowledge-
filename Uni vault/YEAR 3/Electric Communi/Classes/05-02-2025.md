$$10\ log\ \frac{P_2}{1W} =\ X$$
# Amplitude Modulation

- Our signal waveform must be modified so it can travel a long distance
- How to enusure that we can travle a long distance we have to modulate
- When we  modulate we impose our signal on the carrier wave

$$ e_c = E_c SinW_c t$$
$$ e_i = E_i SinW_c t$$

Mixing occurs like 
$$ e_c \times e_i = E_c SinW_ct \times  E_i SinW_c t $$

Fusb = upper sideband frequency
Flsb = lower sideband frequency 

$$f_{usb} = f_i +f_c$$
$$f_{lsb} = f_c +f_i$$

$$P_sb = \frac{M^2}{4} \times P_c$$
