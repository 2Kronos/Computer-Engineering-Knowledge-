# **Amplifier in communication system

- Enable us to increase our signal strength 
- They operate in different frequencies 
	- AM amplifier 
	- FM amplifier
- Amplifier consist of transistors or just an IC 
- The different components will create stray capacitance and inductance
  
- Amplifiers have considerations in linearity and efficiency.
	- Example when we have an input of 1v and output of 2v that is linear.
	- There are some applications where high lineartiy is needed and no drift is needed
	- It means the gain remain constant all times despite your input 
	- It must no take a lot of power it must be power efficient 
	- Balancing this aspect are the important factors to include in transformer operations  

- The condition during which the amplifier has no output is the cut-off mode
	- There is a minimum signal needed for the amplifier to start working i.e input falls short of the threshold
	  
- Even though there is different application or a increase in technology power efficiency, linearity is still important and fundamental concepts

## **Characteristics of an Amplifier in a Communication System**

- **Linearity**
    
    - The amplifier should produce an output that is a scaled version of the input without distortion.
    - If non-linear, it introduces harmonics and intermodulation, distorting the signal.
- **Gain**
    
    - The ratio of output signal power to input signal power, usually expressed in decibels (dB).
    - It determines how much an amplifier boosts the signal strength.
- **Noise**
    
    - Unwanted electrical signals added to the amplified signal.
    - Comes from components (thermal noise) or external interference, affecting signal clarity.
- **Bandwidth**
    
    - The range of frequencies the amplifier can handle effectively.
    - A wider bandwidth allows more data transmission but may introduce more noise.
- **Efficiency**
    
    - Measures how well the amplifier converts input power into useful output power.
    - Higher efficiency reduces power loss in the form of heat.
- **Impedance Matching**
    
    - Ensures maximum power transfer between amplifier stages and connected devices.
    - Poor impedance matching can cause signal reflections and losses.
- **Stability**
    
    - The amplifier should maintain consistent performance without oscillations or unwanted variations.
    - Unstable amplifiers can produce unwanted noise or self-oscillations.
- **Distortion**
    
    - Any deviation of the amplified signal from the original input.
    - Includes harmonic distortion, intermodulation distortion, and phase distortion.
- **Slew Rate**
    
    - The maximum rate of change of output voltage per unit time.
    - A higher slew rate allows better handling of high-frequency signals without distortion.

## **Classes of amplifiers**

![[Pasted image 20250219101503.png]]

The different conduction angles in amplifiers correspond to their **efficiency vs. linearity trade-off** in power amplification. Here’s why each class has a different conduction angle:

### 1. **Class A (360° Conduction)**

![[Pasted image 20250228183405.png]]

- The transistor conducts **throughout the entire cycle** (full 360°).
- Provides **high linearity** and **low distortion**.
- **Least efficient** (max ~25-30%) due to continuous conduction.
- Requires heat sink due to the power loss



### 2. **Class B (180° Conduction)**
![[Pasted image 20250228184957.png]]

- The transistor conducts for **only half the cycle** (180°).
- Higher efficiency (~50-60%) but introduces **crossover distortion** at the transition between positive and negative halves. or from active to cut-off-mode this only happens for non-linear 
  
-  Class B amplifier does not produce output in the second half of the input signal.
  


### 3. **Class AB (180° - 200° Conduction)**
![[Pasted image 20250228185906.png]]
- A compromise between Class A and Class B.
- The transistor conducts slightly **more than 180°** to reduce crossover distortion.
- **Moderate efficiency (~50-70%)** and **better linearity** than Class B.
- Designed to reduce **crossover distortion** in Class B amplifiers.
- Transistors are **slightly biased** to avoid turning off completely.
- They **overlap conduction**, ensuring smoother signal transitions.
- Minimizes the **dead zone**, improving signal quality.
- Balances **efficiency (Class B)** and **low distortion (Class A)**.
- Used in **audio amplifiers, speakers, and communication systems**.

### 4. **Class C (100° - 150° Conduction)**
![[Pasted image 20250228190253.png]]
- The transistor conducts for **less than 180°**.
- Very high efficiency (**>70%**), but **high distortion** (not used for audio but for RF applications with tuned circuits).

### **Summary of classes**

Here’s a concise table summarizing the **different classes of amplifiers** with their characteristics:

|**Class**|**Conduction Angle**|**Efficiency**|**Where Useful**|**Where Not Useful**|**Power & Heat Efficiency**|**Distortion**|**Noise**|**Crossover Points**|**Linearity**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Class A**|360° (full cycle)|~25-30% (Lowest)|**High-fidelity audio, precision circuits**|**Power amplification, RF transmitters**|**High heat dissipation, always on**|**Lowest distortion**|**Low noise**|**None (continuous conduction)**|**Highest (best signal accuracy)**|
|**Class B**|180° (half cycle)|~50-60%|**Radio transmitters, some audio amplifiers**|**Hi-fi audio (crossover distortion issue)**|**Moderate power efficiency, lower heat**|**Crossover distortion present**|**Moderate noise**|**At 0V (signal transition point)**|**Lower than Class A**|
|**Class AB**|180° - 200°|~50-70%|**Hi-fi audio, speaker amplifiers**|**Very high-power applications**|**Better heat efficiency than Class A**|**Lower than Class B (less crossover distortion)**|**Lower than Class B**|**Small overlap reduces crossover issues**|**Good linearity (better than Class B)**|
|**Class C**|100° - 150° (less than half cycle)|**>70% (Highest)**|**RF transmitters, oscillators**|**Audio applications (severe distortion)**|**Very efficient, lowest power loss**|**Very high distortion**|**High noise**|**No output for part of the cycle**|**Poor (only works with tuned circuits)**|

### **Why Different Angles?**

- The conduction angle controls how much of the input waveform is amplified.
- **Longer conduction (closer to 360°) = better linearity, lower efficiency.**
- **Shorter conduction (closer to 100°) = higher efficiency, more distortion.**
- The choice depends on the application: **Class A for hi-fi audio, Class C for RF transmitters, and Class AB for general-purpose amplifiers.**
----
### **Why Class B and Class C Amplifiers Are More Complex**

Class **B** and **C** amplifiers introduce more complexity due to their **non-continuous conduction**, requiring additional circuit design considerations. Here’s why:

### **Summary of Complexity**

|Amplifier|Challenges|Complexity Factors|
|---|---|---|
|**Class B**|Crossover distortion, requires push-pull design|Biasing circuit, phase splitter needed|
|**Class C**|Extreme distortion, requires tuned circuits|LC filter for waveform shaping, careful tuning|

- The **blue line** represents the portion where the amplifier is **conducting power**.
- **Class A** conducts **throughout the full cycle (360°)**.
- When the amplifier **is not producing output**, it is in **cutoff mode**.
- In **Class AB**, the conduction angle should be **slightly less than 360° but more than 180°**, reducing distortion while improving efficiency.
- **Class B** has **lower power consumption** because each transistor conducts for only **half the cycle (180°)**.
- As **complexity increases** in **Class B and Class C**, additional design considerations are needed.
    - How do you determine **the number of cycles** needed?
    - How do you **divide them efficiently**?
    - This can lead to **linearity issues** in amplification.

## How do you know which class to choose

- It depends on the type of application or the use of the system
- Example you cant use a class A as it will draw alot of power due to the conduction time

# **Oscillators

## **Important Points on Oscillators**

- **Oscillators generate carrier signals**
    
    - They produce a **waveform at a fixed frequency**, which acts as the carrier signal.
    - The carrier signal is later **combined with the modulating signal** for communication.
- **Converts DC to AC**
    
    - Oscillators **transform direct current (DC) energy into alternating current (AC)** to generate signals.
- **Repetitive Frequency Output**
    
    - The waveform **repeats at a constant frequency**, making it reliable for communication systems.
      
- **Used in Transmitters**
    
    - Oscillators are found in the **first stage of transmitters** to create a sine wave carrier.
- **Feedback Oscillators** (Common in Communication)
    
    - Most oscillators in communication systems use **feedback to maintain oscillations**.
    - Feedback oscillators generate **pure sine waves with minimal distortion**.
- **How Feedback Works**
    
    - The oscillator **feeds part of its output back into its input** to keep the signal going.
    - This process **continuously regenerates the waveform**, ensuring **stable oscillations**.

### **Simplified Explanation**

Think of an oscillator like a **swing**—when you push it at the right time, it keeps swinging back and forth without stopping. The **feedback mechanism** in oscillators is like that push, ensuring the signal stays **consistent and strong** for communication.

### What to consider when choosing an oscillator                                                   
- Target frequency stability
-  Desired output frequency, Frequency Stability,
- How much wave distortion we can tolerate 
- Required power output

### Different types 
LC Oscillators, 
Hartley Oscillator,
Colpitts Oscillator,
Clapp Oscillator 
Crystal Oscillator.

## LC oscillator

- In the LC oscillator, the amplifier restores the lost energy to derive a constant amplitude sine wave output
---

- We will want to have an **oscillator** that can generate signals with **different frequencies** instead of a fixed one.
- This type of oscillator is called a **variable oscillator**.
- A **variable oscillator** allows **adjustment** of the **output frequency**, making it useful in applications like **radio tuning, signal modulation, and waveform generation**.
- It can be controlled **manually (using a tuning dial or variable resistor)** or **electronically (using voltage-controlled oscillators - VCOs)**.
- Variable oscillators are essential in **communication systems, function generators, and frequency synthesis**.

## Hartley Oscillator

Yes, **variable oscillators** are related to **Hartley oscillators** because the **Hartley oscillator** is a type of **tunable oscillator** that can generate variable frequencies. Here’s how they are connected:

### **Relation Between Variable Oscillators and Hartley Oscillators**

- A **Hartley oscillator** is a type of **LC oscillator** that generates **sinusoidal signals** using an **inductor-capacitor (LC) tank circuit**.
- It is often used as a **variable oscillator** because its frequency can be **adjusted** by changing the **inductance (L) or capacitance (C)** in the circuit.
- **Tuning methods**:
    - **Variable capacitor**: Adjusting the capacitance changes the oscillation frequency.
    - **Tapped inductor**: Varying the inductance by changing the tap point modifies the frequency.
- **Applications**: Hartley oscillators are used in **radio receivers, transmitters, and signal generators**, where a **variable frequency** is needed.

So, the **Hartley oscillator** is a specific type of **variable oscillator** that achieves frequency variation through **inductive tuning**. 

- **Hartley oscillators** use **tapped inductors** and a **capacitor** to generate oscillations.
- The **capacitor connections** provide **feedback** to sustain oscillations.
- Frequency can be varied by **changing the inductor or capacitor**.
- **Used in:** radio transmitters, receivers, audio oscillators, and timing circuits.
- **Simple, inexpensive**, and effective for **high-frequency signal generation**.
- High inductance can be achieved **without a physically large inductor**.

### **Classification of Oscillators Based on Inductor (L), Capacitor (C), and Tap Configuration**

|**Oscillator Type**|**Inductor (L) Configuration**|**Capacitor (C) Configuration**|**Tap/Feedback Mechanism**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**LC Oscillators**|Uses an **inductor (L) and capacitor (C)** to form an LC tank circuit|Capacitor provides energy storage and feedback|Feedback is taken from the LC tank circuit|
|**Hartley Oscillator**|**Tapped inductor** (single coil with a center tap or two inductors in series)|Single capacitor connected across the tapped inductor|Feedback is taken from the **tapped inductor**|
|**Colpitts Oscillator**|Single **inductor**|**Tapped capacitors** (two capacitors in series) across the inductor|Feedback is taken from the **capacitor divider**|
|**Clapp Oscillator**|Single **inductor**|**Three capacitors** (one additional capacitor in series with LC circuit)|A variation of Colpitts with an **extra capacitor for frequency stability**|
|**Crystal Oscillator**|Uses a **quartz crystal** instead of an inductor|Capacitor is used for fine-tuning|Feedback is provided by the **piezoelectric properties of the crystal**|

### **Key Differences**:

- **Hartley** → Feedback from **inductor tap**
- **Colpitts** → Feedback from **capacitor tap**
- **Clapp** → Similar to Colpitts but with an **extra capacitor** for better stability
- **Crystal** → Uses a **quartz crystal** instead of an LC circuit for highly stable frequency
