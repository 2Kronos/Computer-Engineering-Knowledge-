# Summary Notes 

 ## Communication System
- A **communication system** consists of components that transmit and receive information.
- **Signals** carry the information between locations.
- It includes two main parts:
    - **Transmitter** (information source and sender).
    - **Receiver** (information sink and receiver).
- A **channel** connects the transmitter and receiver.

### Signal transmission types:
1. **Simplex**:
        - Signals flow in one direction only.
        - Examples: Radio, Television.
2. **Duplex**:
        - Signals flow in two directions.
        - Types:
            - **Half Duplex**: Alternating communication (e.g., USB, Social Media).
            - **Full Duplex**: Simultaneous communication (e.g., Telephone, Computer Networks).
3. **Multiplex**:
        - Multiple signals are transmitted simultaneously over the same channel.

### Tutorial
1. Can simplex and duplex transmission be upgraded to multiplex?
   
Yes, **simplex** and **duplex** transmissions can be upgraded to **multiplex** by using specific technologies and methods to allow multiple signals to share the same channel. 

- **Simplex to Multiplex**:
    
    - By combining multiple one-directional signals using multiplexing techniques like **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)** or **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**, multiple simplex transmissions can occur over a single channel.
- **Duplex to Multiplex**:
    
    - In **Half Duplex**, multiplexing can allow multiple devices to take turns transmitting and receiving over the same channel.
    - In **Full Duplex**, multiplexing can manage simultaneous multiple two-way communications by separating signals through methods like FDM, TDM, or **Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)**.

**Multiplexing** essentially increases the efficiency and capacity of the channel, regardless of whether it started as simplex or duplex.
