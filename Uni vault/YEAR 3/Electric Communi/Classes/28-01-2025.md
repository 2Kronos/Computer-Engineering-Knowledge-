# Summary Notes 
## Communication systems

- A **communication system** consists of components that transmit and receive information.
- **Signals** carry the information between locations.
- It includes two main parts:
    - **Transmitter** (information source and sender).
    - **Receiver** (information sink and receiver).
- A **channel** connects the transmitter and receiver.

### Signal transmission types:
1. **Simplex**:
        - Signals flow in one direction only.
        - Examples: Radio, Television.
2. **Duplex**:
        - Signals flow in two directions.
        - Types:
            - **Half Duplex**: Alternating communication (e.g., USB, Social Media).
            - **Full Duplex**: Simultaneous communication (e.g., Telephone, Computer Networks).
3. **Multiplex**:
        - Multiple signals are transmitted simultaneously over the same channel.

### Tutorial
1. Identify and mention examples 
2. Can simplex and duplex transmission be upgraded to multiplex?
<u> Answer</u>

1. TDM (Time division Multuplexing) – Digital voice calls - FMD (Frequency Division Multiplexing) – Radio and anal
2. Yes, **simplex** and **duplex** transmissions can be upgraded to **multiplex** by using specific technologies and methods to allow multiple signals to share the same channel. 

- **Simplex to Multiplex**:
    
    - By combining multiple one-directional signals using multiplexing techniques like **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)** or **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**, multiple simplex transmissions can occur over a single channel.
- **Duplex to Multiplex**:
    
    - In **Half Duplex**, multiplexing can allow multiple devices to take turns transmitting and receiving over the same channel.
    - In **Full Duplex**, multiplexing can manage simultaneous multiple two-way communications by separating signals through methods like FDM, TDM, or **Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)**.

**Multiplexing** essentially increases the efficiency and capacity of the channel, regardless of whether it started as simplex or duplex.


## Parameters in Communication System

- **Signals in a communication system** are represented using current, voltage, and power, measurable at input and output ports.
- A **port** is a terminal for receiving or sending signals.
- **Amplifier example**:
    - **Input port**: Receives the signal.
    - **Output port**: Delivers the amplified signal.
- Amplifiers handle signals with varying magnitudes of current, voltage, and power.
- Writing output signals for all input variations is difficult, so performance evaluation systems are needed.
- The challenge applies to other components, but input and output power can still be measured.
- Ratio of the power at input ports and the ouput ports can be computed as decibels to 
<u> describe communication system component performance</u>

- Gain expression for power

$$A_{db}=10\log_{10}(\frac{P_2}{P_1})$$
- Gain expression for voltage 

$$A_{db}=10\log_{10}(\frac{V_2}{V_1})^2$$

$$P =\ \frac{V_2}{R}$$
$P_1$ = input power 
$P_2$ = output power.
$V_1$ = input voltage.
$V_2$ = output voltage.

### Tutorial question 
3. Derive the current equivalent of the gain (dB) expression
<u> Answer</u>

$$A_{db}=10\log_{10}(\frac{V_2}{V_1})^2$$
$$A_{db}=10\times 2 \log_{10}(\frac{V_2}{V_1})$$
$$A_{db}=20\log_{10}(\frac{I_2 R_2}{I_1 R_1 })$$
if $R_1=R_2$ (Resistance are the same )
$$A_{db}=20\log_{10}(\frac{I_2 }{I_1 })$$
