### **Summary of Notes**

- A **transistor** is a semiconductor device used to **rectify, amplify, and switch** electronic signals.
- It is essential for digital circuits (e.g., processors, memory chips) and amplifying weak signals (e.g., microphones, TV antennas).
- The two main types are **Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs)** and **Field Effect Transistors (FETs)**.
- A **BJT** has three layers: **Emitter, Base, and Collector**. The emitter and collector are heavily doped, while the base is lightly doped.
- **How a transistor works as a switch:**
    - **Forward biased base-emitter junction → ON (current flows from emitter to collector).**
    - **Reverse biased base-emitter junction → OFF (no current flows).**
- **How a transistor works as an amplifier:**
    - A small base current controls a much larger collector current.
    - In **common emitter configuration**, input at the base controls output at the collector, amplifying the signal.
    - A **load resistor** at the collector helps extract the amplified output.

### **How a Transistor Works as an Amplifier**

- The transistor functions like a **valve** in a water pipe: a small base current controls a larger collector current, just like a small valve adjustment controls water flow.
- When an **AC signal** is applied to the base, it modulates the base-emitter junction voltage.
- This variation in base current causes a **proportional change** in collector current, leading to **signal amplification**.
- The amplified output signal is obtained from the collector-emitter circuit, making the weak input signal stronger.
