1. **What is the role of resonance in an oscillator?**  
   
    Resonance plays a crucial role in oscillators by allowing the circuit to sustain continuous oscillations at a specific frequency. It occurs when the inductive and capacitive reactances in an LC circuit cancel each other out, maximizing energy transfer with minimal loss. This ensures a stable oscillation frequency, making resonance essential for reliable signal generation in oscillators.
    
2. **Estimate the conduction angle(s) for Class AC & BC amplifiers.**

- **Class A**: Conduction angle = **360°** (the transistor conducts throughout the entire input cycle).
- **Class B**: Conduction angle = **180°** (the transistor conducts for only half of the input cycle).
- **Class C**: Conduction angle **< 180°** (the transistor conducts for less than half of the cycle).
- **Class AB**: Conduction angle **between 180° and 360°**, balancing efficiency and distortion.
- For **Class AC** amplifiers, the conduction angle is likely between **180° and 360°**, similar to a Class AB amplifier, meaning the transistor conducts for more than half but not the full cycle.
- For **Class BC** amplifiers, the conduction angle would be **slightly less than 180°**, meaning the transistor operates close to Class B but with some distortion characteristics of Class C.

3. **What do you understand by non-linearity in oscillators?**  
   
    Non-linearity in oscillators refers to deviations from a perfectly proportional relationship between input and output signals. This is caused by component limitations, supply voltage fluctuations, and signal distortion. Non-linearity can lead to unwanted harmonics, amplitude instability, and performance degradation, which affect the accuracy and efficiency of oscillators in communication systems.
    
2. **Explain frequency stability in relation to oscillators.**  
   
    Frequency stability is the ability of an oscillator to maintain a constant frequency over time, despite external influences such as temperature variations, power supply fluctuations, and component aging. High frequency stability is essential in communication systems to ensure signal integrity and prevent deviation from the intended operating frequency, which could lead to errors or interference in transmissions.
