### **Q1:**  
AM isn’t widely used because it’s easily affected by noise, making transmissions unreliable. It also has a much narrower bandwidth than FM, which gives FM a clear advantage in terms of signal quality and performance.

### **Q2:**  
To prevent interference, AM relies on carrier frequency stability, while FM maintains its frequency stability through indirect FM. Although AM uses less bandwidth, FM has built-in bandwidth limits to ensure it stays within the allocated spectrum.

### **Q3:**  
Narrowband FM is more efficient because it uses less bandwidth, which reduces interference and minimizes resource consumption for other transmissions.

### **Q4:**  
In AM, the **modulation index** is the ratio of the amplitude of the modulating signal to the amplitude of the carrier signal. In FM, it’s the ratio of the carrier frequency deviation to the frequency of the modulating signal.

### **Q5:**

- **Radio broadcasting** (e.g., music and news stations)
- **Two-way mobile communication** (e.g., walkie-talkies)

### **Q6:**

- **Audio Broadcasting:** Better signal quality (less noise), wider coverage, and market demand.
- **Mobile Two-Way Radio:** More reliable (less interference), portable, and more affordable than base station setups.
