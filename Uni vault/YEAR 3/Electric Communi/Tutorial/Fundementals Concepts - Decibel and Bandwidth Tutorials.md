### Tutorial 1 (Pg 4)
1] Identify and mention examples 
2] Can simplex and duplex transmission be upgraded to multiplex?
<u> Answer</u>

1] TDM (Time division Multiplexing) – Digital voice calls 
	 FMD (Frequency Division Multiplexing) – Radio and anal
2] Yes, **simplex** and **duplex** transmissions can be upgraded to **multiplex** by using specific technologies and methods to allow multiple signals to share the same channel. 

- **Simplex to Multiplex**:
    
    - By combining multiple one-directional signals using multiplexing techniques like **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)** or **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**, multiple simplex transmissions can occur over a single channel.
- **Duplex to Multiplex**:
    
    - In **Half Duplex**, multiplexing can allow multiple devices to take turns transmitting and receiving over the same channel.
    - In **Full Duplex**, multiplexing can manage simultaneous multiple two-way communications by separating signals through methods like FDM, TDM, or **Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)**.

**Multiplexing** essentially increases the efficiency and capacity of the channel, regardless of whether it started as simplex or duplex.

### Tutorial 2 (Pg 7)
1] Derive the current equivalent of the gain (dB) expression
<u> Answer</u>
1]
$$A_{db}=10\log_{10}(\frac{V_2}{V_1})^2$$
$$A_{db}=10\times 2 \log_{10}(\frac{V_2}{V_1})$$
$$A_{db}=20\log_{10}(\frac{I_2 R_2}{I_1 R_1 })$$
if $R_1=R_2$ (Resistance are the same )

$$A_{db}=20\log_{10}(\frac{I_2 }{I_1 })$$

### Tutorial 4 (Pg 16)

1] Search for the most recent National Radio Frequency Plan from ICASA.
2] Mention popular network applications in each frequency range from the recent frequency plan.

<u> Answer</u>
1] National Radio Frequency Plan 2021 (NRFP-21) is the most recent


2] LF (low freq) - AM radio broadcast 
	MF – Am radio broadcast 
	HF – Aviation communication 
	VHF – FM radio broadcast 
	UHF – WiFi
	SHF – 5G mobile network
	EHF – Satellite communication
