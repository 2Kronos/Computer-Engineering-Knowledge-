**Detailed Concept Breakdown:**
1. **ELAPSED TIME**  
   - `millis() - startTime` calculates precise duration between events  
   - Used to trigger actions after exact 1000ms intervals  
   - More accurate than simple `delay()` for timing-sensitive operations  

2. **CONDITIONALS**  
   - `if` statement acts as a time-based gatekeeper  
   - Only executes the code block when 1000ms has passed  
   - Creates non-blocking timing (unlike `delay` which freezes execution)
