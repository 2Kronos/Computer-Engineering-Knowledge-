# 6.1 Experiment with mills() function
# 6.2 After pressing the button for 1 second the LED will come on

# 6.3 Using modulus
- This helps us to wrap around the value 255 so after every time thst the number is divisible by 255 it  goes 
# 6.4 One led goes high every second

# 6.5 Led increases in brightness 

# 6.6 Make the onboard LED go on and off 

# 6.7 Each one should increase in brightness out of phase

Increase the number of counts to be bigger than 255
- They start at a different intensity of brightness

```c++
 LED_brigthness(0, result,0);
   LED_brigthness(1, result,85);
  LED_brigthness(2, result,170);

}

void  LED_brigthness(int LED_NUM, int intensity, int phase){
	analogWrite(pinNum[LED_NUM], intensity);
  	intensity = intensity + phase;
}
```

- Here we add our intensity and then add the phase
		- The problem we face where is when our intensity is e.g 255 then the new intensity will be more than 255 
		- We need to keep around 255 
		- We use the same principle as the 360 value of a circile on a car
