# 3.1: When we press the button it should print that the button has been pushed in the serial Monitor

```c++
bool userIn;

void setup();
{.....}
void loop()
{
 userIn = digitalRead(2);
  if (userIn == true){
   Serial.println("Button pressed");
  }
  ............
  .........
}
```

- Here we will have to hold the button in order for us to get an output on the serial monitor
- This is due to the delays. the button checking function is ontop so it will only happen after all the other code has been executed then it will loop back the beginning and theck if the button has been pressed

# 3.2 Change code so that button immediately and print out once only when it is pressed

```c++

void h_delay(int time) {

 for (int c = 0; c < time; c++) {

  delay(1);

  userIn = digitalRead(2);

  if (userIn == true && user_prev == false){

   String msg = String("Button pressed ") + String(c); 

   Serial.println(msg);
    //button_state = true; // indicate that button is pressed
    
  }
 }
}
```

```c++
if (userIn == true && user_prev == false)
```

- This ensures the button press is **only detected on the transition from `0` to `1`** (rising edge).
- When this condition is met, it prints a message with the current loop iteration (`c`).

<u> Purpose of C variable </u>

- This the loop counter
- Example if 400 was the int time the loop will run for 399 times
- Due to the delay(1) it being called in each itteration making the total delay time approx `time` miliseconds
- During that 399 milli seconds if the button is pressed it the current c iteration of the for loop will printed out aswell
