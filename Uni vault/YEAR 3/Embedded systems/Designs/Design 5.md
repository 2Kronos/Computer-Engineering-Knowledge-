- We  will only use the PWM 
- We use the array to focus on the specific pin
- We say 255 its the max write 

# 5.3 Make the LED go brighter and brighter

# 5.5.1 One LED at a times goes brighter

- We do not want repeated code
- The Arduino has a slow processor

# 5.5.2 Does the same thing at 5.5.1 but when the last led flashes it must go in opposite direction

# 5.5.3 Make the code shorter remove duplicates 

# 5.6 Make one go brighter while the other LED goes dimmer 

- Analog does not work wit
