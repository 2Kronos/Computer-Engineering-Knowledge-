- This circuit is constructed in parallel form
- The LED are in parallel with one another they are also placed in the opposite polarity.
- The current will want to flow to the place with the lowest resistance and the pin will 
```c++
digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(10, LOW);
  delay(400); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  //Make the whole thing off for a while
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  digitalWrite(10, LOW);
  
  //Delay
  delay(400);
  
  //End of the both low scenario
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  digitalWrite(10, HIGH);
  
  delay(400); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  //Make the whole thing off for a while
  
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  digitalWrite(10, LOW);
  //Delay
  delay(400);
  //End of the both low scenario
```

- Each pin will go high at a different time so that will therefore one LED will be high at a time

<u>Scenario 1 Red LED on</u>
- Pin 13 will go high and when it comes to green LED which in reverse biased (- then +) the high resistance will stop the current from going to the green LED and it will take the route of least resistsance 
- It will go therefore go to the red LED which is forward biased (+ then -).
- This will cause the RED LED to go on and the green LED will go off
  
<u> Scenario 2 </u> 
- We set both pins off so we can see when the other one is on

<u> Scenario 3 Green LED off</u>

- Pin 10 will be proving the power now so the power will go from pin 10
- It will get to the parallel connection where the current would normally flow both ways 
- But due to the reverse bias (- then +) it will not flow to the RED led due to the high resistance
- It will therefore
