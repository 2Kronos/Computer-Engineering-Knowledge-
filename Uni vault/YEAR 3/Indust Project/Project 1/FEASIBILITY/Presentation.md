### **Presentation Script: Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm**

#### **Slide 1: Introduction**

Good [morning/afternoon], everyone.  
I’m excited to present my project: the **Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm**, an intuitive solution to simplify robotic arm control.

#### **Slide 2: The Problem**

- Traditional robotic arms rely on complex controls like joysticks or coding.
- Some environments are too hazardous for direct human intervention.
- 

#### **Slide 3: The Solution**

- A **gesture-controlled robotic arm** mimicking hand movements therefore introduces hand free operations
- A sensor-equipped glove sends wireless commands to the robotic arm.
- **Easy, intuitive, and accessible** for all users.

#### **Slide 4: How It Works**

- **Servo motors** ensure precise movement; a **stepper motor** enables smooth rotation.
- The **gripper** picks and places objects, useful in various applications.
- **Wireless Bluetooth control** allows flexible, remote operation.

#### **Slide 5: Impact**

- **Healthcare**: Assists those with limited mobility.
- **Education**: Introduces students to robotics.
- **Industry**: Enhances efficiency and safety.

#### **Slide 6: Scalability**

- Can be adapted for **drones, wheelchairs, or smart home systems**.
- AI can enable more complex gesture recognition.
- Uses **affordable, off-the-shelf components**, making it easy to expand.

#### **Slide 7: Conclusion**

The **Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm** simplifies control, making robotics more accessible.  
Its impact on **healthcare, education, and industry** is vast, with room for future growth.  
Thank you! I’m happy to take questions.
