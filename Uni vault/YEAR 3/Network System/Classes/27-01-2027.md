>[!The network core]  
>Mesh of interconnected routers  
>Packet-switching: hosts break application-layer messages into *packets*  
>Network forwards packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destination  
>
>**Examples of networks:**  
>Mobile network  
>National or global ISP  
>Local or regional ISP  
>Home network  
>Content provider network  
>Datacenter network  
>Enterprise network

>[!Two key network-core functions]  
>**Forwarding:**  
>aka “switching”  
>Local action: move arriving packets from router’s input link to appropriate router output link  
>
>**Routing:**  
>Global action: determine source-destination paths taken by packets  
>Routing algorithms  
>
>**Example of local forwarding table:**  
>| header value | output link |  
>|--------------|-------------|  
>| 0100         | 3           |  
>| 0101         | 2           |  
>| 0111         | 2           |  
>| 1001         | 1           |

>**Destination address in arriving packet’s header**

>[!Packet-switching: store-and-forward]  
>\( L \) bits per packet  
>Packet transmission delay: takes \( L/R \) seconds to transmit (push out) \( L \)-bit packet into link at \( R \) bps  
>**Store and forward:** entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link  
>
>**One-hop numerical example:**  
>\ $( L = 10 \, \text{Kbits} \)$ 
>\( R = 100 \, \text{Mbps} \)  
>One-hop transmission delay = \( 0.1 \, \text{msec} \)$

---

>[!Packet-switching: queueing]  
>Queueing occurs when work arrives faster than it can be serviced.  
>If arrival rate (in bps) to link exceeds transmission rate (bps) of link for some period of time:  
>Packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link  
>Packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) in router fills up  

---

>[!Alternative to packet switching: circuit switching]  
>End-end resources allocated to, reserved for “call” between source and destination  
>Dedicated resources: no sharing  
>Circuit-like (guaranteed) performance  
>Circuit segment idle if not used by call (no sharing)  
>Commonly used in traditional telephone networks  
>
>**Example:**  
>In diagram, each link has four circuits.  
>Call gets \(2^{nd}\) circuit in top link and \(1^{st}\) circuit in right link.

>[!Circuit switching: FDM and TDM]  
>**Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):**  
>Optical, electromagnetic frequencies divided into (narrow) frequency bands  
>Each call allocated its own band, can transmit at max rate of that narrow band  
>
>**Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):**  
>Time divided into slots  
>Each call allocated periodic slot(s), can transmit at maximum rate of (wider) frequency band (only) during its time slot(s)

>[!Packet switching versus circuit switching]  
>**Example:**  
>1 Gb/s link  
>Each user:  
>100 Mb/s when “active”  
>Active 10% of time  
>
>**Q:** How many users can use this network under circuit-switching and packet switching?  
>**Circuit-switching:** 10 users  
>**Packet switching:** with 35 users, probability > 10 active at same time is less than .0004  
>
>**Q:** How did we get value 0.0004?  
>A: HW problem (for those with course in probability only)

>[!Packet switching versus circuit switching]  
>Is packet switching a “slam dunk winner”?  
>
>**Great for “bursty” data** – sometimes has data to send, but at other times not  
>Resource sharing  
>Simpler, no call setup  
>
>**Excessive congestion possible:** packet delay and loss due to buffer overflow  
>Protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control  
>
>**Q:** How to provide circuit-like behavior with packet-switching?  
>“It’s complicated.” We’ll study various techniques that try to make packet switching as “circuit-like” as possible.  
>
>**Q:** Human analogies of reserved resources (circuit switching) versus on-demand allocation (packet switching)?

>[!Internet structure: a “network of networks”]  
>Hosts connect to Internet via access Internet Service Providers (ISPs)  
>Access ISPs in turn must be interconnected  
>So that *any* two hosts (*anywhere!*) can send packets to each other  
>Resulting network of networks is very complex  
>Evolution driven by economics, national policies  
>
>**Let’s take a stepwise approach to describe current Internet structure**  

---

>[!Internet structure: a “network of networks”]  
>**Question:** Given **millions** of access ISPs, how to connect them together?  
>
>Connecting each access ISP to each other directly doesn’t scale: \( O(N^2) \) connections.  
>
>**Option:** Connect each access ISP to one global transit ISP?  
>Customer and provider ISPs have economic agreement.  
>
>**But if one global ISP is viable business, there will be competitors ….**  
>Competitors will want to be connected via **Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)** and **peering links**.  
>
>**Regional networks** may arise to connect access nets to ISPs.  
>**Content provider networks** (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Akamai) may run their own network, to bring services, content close to end users.

>[!Internet structure: a “network of networks”]  
>At “center”: small # of well-connected large networks  
>“Tier-1” commercial ISPs (e.g., Level 3, Sprint, AT&T, NTT), national & international coverage  
>Content provider networks (e.g., Google, Facebook): private network that connects its data centers to Internet, often bypassing tier-1, regional ISPs  
>
>**Example of Tier-1 ISP Network map: Sprint (2019)**  
>**Sprint Node**  
>**Sprint Ethernet POP or Sprint Virtual POP**  
>**Landing Station**  
>**Sprint Network Backbone**  
>**Sprint Network Coverage**

>**POP:** point-of-presence to/from other Sprint POPs  
>Links to peering networks  
>Links to/from Sprint customer networks
