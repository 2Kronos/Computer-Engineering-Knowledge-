# Packet dela: four sources



- <u>Processing Delay</u>:  
	  - Refers to the time taken to process a packet in a network device.  
	  - Includes tasks like:  
	    - **Forwarding table lookup**.  
	    - **Forwarding the packet through the switch**.  
	    - **Performing integrity checks**.  
	  - Typically very short, on the order of **microseconds or less**.


- <u>Queuing Delay </u> 
	  - The second component of delay in networking.  
	  - Refers to the time a packet spends waiting in a queue at an output link before it can be transmitted.  
	  - The duration of queuing delay depends on:  
	    - The **congestion level** of the outgoing link.  
	    - Higher congestion leads to longer queuing delays.

 >[!Transmission Delay]
> Occurs once a packet begins transmission.  
> Refers to the time it takes to push **all the bits of the packet** into the outgoing link.  
 
    
    - The **number of bits in the packet (L)**.  
    - The **transmission rate of the link (R)**.  
  - Calculated as:  
    \[
    \text{Transmission Delay} = \frac{L}{R}
    \]

- **Propagation Delay**:  
  - The time it takes for a **single bit** to travel from the **sending side** of a link to the **receiving side**.  
  - Depends on:  
    - The **physical distance** between the sender and receiver.  
    - The **propagation speed** of the medium (e.g., fiber, copper).  
  - Unlike transmission delay, it is independent of the packet size or transmission rate.
