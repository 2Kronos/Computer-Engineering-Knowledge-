Here’s a **simpler** explanation of the network attacks:

### **1. Packet Interception (Packet Sniffing)**

- Attackers **eavesdrop** on network traffic to steal data.
- Works in **shared networks** (Wi-Fi, Ethernet).
- Uses **special software** (e.g., Wireshark) to capture all passing data, including **passwords**.

### **2. Fake Identity (IP Spoofing)**

- Attacker **fakes** their identity by using a **false IP address**.
- Sends **misleading packets** to trick the target into believing it’s from a trusted source.
- Used in hacking and **bypassing security checks**.

### **3. Denial of Service (DoS)**

- Attackers **overload** a server or network with fake traffic, making it **unusable** for real users.
- Steps:
    1. Pick a **target**.
    2. Hack **multiple computers** (botnet).
    3. Flood the target with **too many requests**.

### **Protection Against Network Attacks**:  
1. **Authentication**:  
   - Use **authentication** to verify identity before granting network access.  
     - Examples: Passwords, SIM cards in smartphones (hardware-based identity).  

1. **Confidentiality**:  
   - Protect data by **encrypting packet contents**.  

1. **Integrity checks**:  
   - Use **digital signatures** to ensure:  
     - The data was sent by a verified sender.  
     - The data was not altered during transmission.  

1. **Access restriction**:  
   - Implement **access control**:  
     - Specify who can perform what actions.  
     - Require authentication before granting access.  
     - Example: UMass campus wireless network requires authentication for access.  

5. **Firewalls**:  
   - Specialized hardware or software that detects and mitigates attacks.  
   - Placed at **edge and core networks**.  
   - Can be programmed to:  
     - Allow or block specific users or traffic types.  
     - Control inbound and outbound network traffic.
