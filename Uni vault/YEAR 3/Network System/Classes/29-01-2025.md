## "Nuts and Bolts view" 
- Billions of connected devices made up of hosts
- <u>Packets switches </u>: Routers
	- Switches sit near devices, they take lots of input and send it as one signal
- <u>Communication links</u>: Fibre, Satellite 
- <u>Networks</u> : Collection device, router links.
	- Enterprise network: Intra network
(Round router, Square switche in slide)

### Definitions

1. Switch: Not aware of the network
		What ever signal, input etc it get it pushes out (Plug and play device).
		Take a packet and push it out of a port
2. <u>Routing</u> : Aware of the network
		Does routing
		Knows which port to send the signal

# Internet "Nuts and Bolts" View

- <u>Internet</u>: "Networks"
- <u>Protocols</u> : Control sending, recieving messages 
	- In the slide Skype will be known as propriety protocol as it owned by a private company
- <u> Internet Standards</u> 

# What is a protocol 

- Rules for communication
- Different protocol for different layers
