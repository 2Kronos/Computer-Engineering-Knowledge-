## **Domain Name System (DNS)**:

- AÂ **distributed database**Â that translates:
    
    - **Hostnames**Â andÂ **services**Â toÂ **IP addresses**.
        
    - **IP addresses**Â toÂ **hostnames**Â andÂ **services**.
        

### **Key Features of DNS**:

1. **Distributed Hierarchy**:
    
    - DNS servers are organized in aÂ **hierarchical structure**Â spread across the Internet.
        
    - They communicate with each other to provide name translation services.
        
2. **Application Layer Service**:
    
    - DNS is implemented as anÂ **application layer protocol**.
        
    - Operates onÂ **servers at the network edge**, not on routers or switches within the network core.
        
3. **Internet Design Philosophy**:
    
    - **Keep the network core simple**: Routers and switches focus on forwarding packets.
        
    - **Push complexity to the edge**: Services like DNS handle advanced functionality.

### **DNS and Load Balancing**:

- **Load Balancing Function**:
    
    - DNS can distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to balance the load.
        
- **How It Works**:
    
    - For a requested service (e.g., a web server), there may beÂ **multiple IP addresses**Â associated with the service.
        
    - DNSÂ **rotates**Â among these IP addresses when responding to queries.
        
    - ReturnsÂ **one IP address**Â at a time as the primary service for the client.
        
- **Benefits**:
    
    - Distributes traffic evenly across servers.
        
    - ImprovesÂ **scalability**Â andÂ **reliability**Â of services.

### **Why DNS is Distributed (Not Centralized)**:

1. **Traffic Concentration**:
    
    - A centralized DNS system would create aÂ **huge concentration of traffic**Â at a single point.
        
2. **Performance Requirements**:
    
    - DNS queries requireÂ **low latency**Â (milliseconds matter).
        
    - A centralized system would result inÂ **long RTT (Round-Trip Time)**Â delays for users far from the central server.
        
3. **Scalability**:
    
    - The Internet handlesÂ **trillions of DNS queries daily**Â (e.g., Akamai alone handles over a trillion requests per day).
        
    - A centralized system cannot scale to meet this demand.
        
4. **Resiliency and Capabilities**:
    
    - A distributed system provides:
        
        - **Better computational capabilities**.
            
        - **Higher resiliency**Â against failures.
            
        - **Improved performance**Â for users globally.
          
- DNS can be thought of as aÂ **highly distributed, scalable, and high-performance database**Â that translates domain names to IP addresses efficiently.

## **DNS Hierarchy**:

1. **Root DNS Servers**:
    
    - Located at the top of the hierarchy.
        
    - Provide information aboutÂ **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**Â servers.
        
2. **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers**:
    
    - Responsible for domains likeÂ **.com**,Â **.edu**,Â **.net**, etc.
        
    - Provide information aboutÂ **authoritative name servers**Â for specific domains.
        
3. **Authoritative Name Servers**:
    
    - Have theÂ **ultimate responsibility**Â for resolving names within their domain (e.g.,Â **umass.edu**,Â **nyu.edu**,Â **pbs.org**).

### **DNS Resolution Process (Example:Â [www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/))**:

1. **Client Contacts Root DNS Server**:
    
    - Gets the address of theÂ **TLD server**Â forÂ **.com**.
        
2. **Client Contacts TLD Server**:
    
    - Gets the address of theÂ **authoritative name server**Â forÂ **amazon.com**.
        
3. **Client Contacts Authoritative Name Server**:
    
    - Gets theÂ **IP address**Â forÂ **[www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/)**.

 1. Root DNS Servers:

	- **Role**:
	    
	    - Act as the starting point for DNS resolution when a server cannot resolve a name.
	        
	    - Provide information aboutÂ **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**Â servers but do not perform the final translation.
	        
	- **Importance**:
	    
	    - Critical to the functioning of the Internet, often compared to theÂ **central nervous system**.
	        
	- **Security**:
	    
	    - Highly secure due to their critical role.
	        
	- **Management**:
	    
	    - Managed byÂ **ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)**, which oversees the root servers and associated infrastructure.

2. **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers**:
    
    - Responsible for resolving domain names with specific endings (e.g.,Â **.com**,Â **.edu**,Â **.net**,Â **.org**).
        
    - Managed byÂ **Internet Registries**:
        
        - Organizations that oversee TLDs and handle domain name registrations (e.g., registering a newÂ **.com**Â orÂ **.edu**Â name).
            
3. **Authoritative Name Servers**:
    
    - Responsible for resolving namesÂ **within an organization**Â (e.g.,Â **umass.edu**,Â **nyu.edu**).
        
    - **"The buck stops here"**:
        
        - These servers have theÂ **final authority**Â over their domainâ€™s name-to-IP mappings.
            
4. **Local DNS Servers**:
    
    - Every host on the Internet has an associatedÂ **local DNS server**.
        
    - **Role**:
        
        - Acts as theÂ **first point of contact**Â for a host when resolving a name.
            
        - If the local DNS server has the requested name-to-IP mappingÂ **cached locally**, it responds immediately.
            
        - If not, it initiates theÂ **DNS resolution process**Â (querying root, TLD, and authoritative servers

### **What is DNS Name Resolution?**

DNS (Domain Name System) name resolution is the process of converting a website's domain name (like `google.com`) into its corresponding IP address (like `142.250.190.78`). Since computers communicate using IP addresses, but humans prefer using easy-to-remember domain names, DNS acts as a "phonebook" for the internet.

---

### **Example: Resolving `gaia.cs.umass.edu` from `engineering.nyu.edu`**

If a computer at `engineering.nyu.edu` wants to find the IP address of `gaia.cs.umass.edu`, the following steps happen:

1. **Check Local Cache:**
    
    - The host (`engineering.nyu.edu`) first checks if it already knows the IP for `gaia.cs.umass.edu` (stored in a cache from a previous request).
    - If found, it uses that IP directly.
    - If not, it moves to the next step.
2. **Ask the Local DNS Server (Recursive Resolver):**
    
    - The request is sent to the local DNS resolver (often provided by the ISP or a university's IT department).
    - If the resolver has the answer cached, it returns the IP. Otherwise, it starts querying other DNS servers.
3. **Query the Root DNS Server:**
    
    - If the resolver doesnâ€™t have the IP, it contacts a Root DNS Server.
    - The Root Server doesnâ€™t know the IP but directs the query to the appropriate **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Server** (e.g., `.edu`).
4. **Query the TLD Server (`.edu` in this case):**
    
    - The TLD Server directs the query to the **Authoritative Name Server** for `umass.edu`.
5. **Query the Authoritative Name Server:**
    
    - The authoritative server for `umass.edu` knows the exact IP for `gaia.cs.umass.edu` and responds with the IP address.
6. **Return the IP to the Host:**
    
    - The local resolver stores the IP in its cache and sends it back to `engineering.nyu.edu`.
7. **Connecting to `gaia.cs.umass.edu`:**
    
    - The host (`engineering.nyu.edu`) now knows the IP and establishes a direct connection.

---

### **Summary of the Process:**

1. **Check cache** â†’ 2. **Ask local DNS resolver** â†’ 3. **Query Root DNS server** â†’ 4. **Ask `.edu` TLD server** â†’ 5. **Get answer from `umass.edu` authoritative server** â†’ 6. **Send IP back to `engineering.nyu.edu`** â†’ 7. **Connect to `gaia.cs.umass.edu`**.

This process ensures that domain names can be quickly translated into IP addresses, allowing users to browse the internet seamlessly. ðŸš€

### **DNS Caching and Iterated Queries resolution**:

1. **DNS Caching**:
    
    - Reduces query traffic by storing previously resolved name-to-IP mappings locally.
        
    - If a local DNS server has a cached result, it can respond immediately without querying other servers.
        
2. **Iterated Query**:
    
    - A type of DNS query where theÂ **local DNS server**Â iteratively contacts other servers (root, TLD, authoritative) to resolve a name as the one in the above example.
        
    - Example:
        
        - The local DNS server atÂ **NYU**Â queries:
            
            1. **Root DNS server**.
                
            2. **TLD DNS server**Â (e.g., forÂ **.edu**).
                
            3. **Authoritative DNS server**Â (e.g., forÂ **gaia.cs.umass.edu**).
                
        - Continues until the name is resolved.

### **Recursive Query Resolution**:

1. **Definition**:
    
    - In recursive query resolution, theÂ **name server**Â (e.g., local DNS server) takes full responsibility for resolving the query.
        
    - Instead of providing a "try next server" response (as in iterative queries), itÂ **recursively contacts other servers**Â until it obtains a definitive answer.
        
2. **Process**:
    
    - The client sends a query to the local DNS server.
        
    - The local DNS server:
        
        - Contacts other DNS servers (root, TLD, authoritative) on behalf of the client.
            
        - Returns theÂ **final resolved IP address**Â to the client.
            
3. **Example**:
    
    - The local DNS server resolves the query forÂ **gaia.cs.umass.edu**Â by recursively querying:
        
        1. **Root DNS server**.
            
        2. **TLD DNS server**Â (e.g., forÂ **.edu**).
            
        3. **Authoritative DNS server**Â (e.g., forÂ **umass.edu**).
            
    - Returns the final IP address to the client.

### **Steps to Establish an Internet Presence**:

1. **Register Your Domain Name**:
    
    - Choose a domain name (e.g.,Â **networkutopia.com**).
        
    - Register it with aÂ **DNS registrar**Â (e.g., Network Solutions).
        
2. **Obtain IP Addresses**:
    
    - Acquire a range of IP addresses for your servers (details on how to get these are discussed in Chapter 4).
        
3. **Provide Authoritative Name Server Information**:
    
    - Give the registrar:
        
        - TheÂ **name**Â of your authoritative name server.
            
        - TheÂ **IP address**Â of your authoritative name server.
            
    - The registrar will:
        
        - Insert anÂ **NS record**Â (Name Server record) for your domain.
            
        - Insert anÂ **A record**Â (Address record) for your authoritative name serverâ€™s IP address into the global DNS database.
            
4. **Set Up Your Authoritative Name Server**:
    
    - Bring up your authoritative name server.
        
    - Populate it withÂ **resource records**Â (e.g., A, CNAME, MX) for all servers and services in your network.
        

---

### **Key Points**:

- DNS is essential for making your servers accessible by name (e.g.,Â **networkutopia.com**).
    
- The registrar handles the global DNS entries, while your authoritative name server manages the internal DNS records.

----

### **DNS Security Measures**:

1. **Protection Against Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**:
    
    - Primarily achieved usingÂ **firewalls**Â to filter and block malicious traffic.
        
2. **Authentication for Record Integrity**:
    
    - Ensures that onlyÂ **authorized sources**Â can add or modify DNS records.
        
    - **Authentication services**Â (e.g., DNSSEC - DNS Security Extensions) play a critical role in verifying the authenticity of DNS data.
