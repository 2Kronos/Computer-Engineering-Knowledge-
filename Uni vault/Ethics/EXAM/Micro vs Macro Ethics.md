Engineers today must understand both micro and macro ethical issues in their work

# Micro issues 

- Focus on decisions made by individuals and companies on their projects 
- Deal with specific project-related choices
- Impact immediate stakeholders

# Macro issue 

- Address broader global concerns
- Include technological development directions
- Involve laws and collective responsibilities
- Affect professional societies and consumer groups

### Example: SUVs

<u>Micro issues</u>
arose with the Ford Explorer and Bridgestone/Firestone tires. In the late 1990s, tire tread separation led to blowouts and rollovers, causing deaths and injuries. Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone blamed each other, revealing multiple sources of the hazard, including flawed tire design and poor quality control.

<u>Macro issues </u>
focus on SUVs being harmful due to gas-guzzling, pollution, instability, and higher accident fatality rates. Keith Bradsher estimates SUVs cause around 3,000 excess deaths annually due to rollovers, collisions, and respiratory issues from smog.


## Key Questions

- Should engineering examine SUV issues collectively?
- What role should engineers play in addressing these concerns?
- Who should take responsibility: engineers, consumer groups, or lawmakers?

## Future Considerations

- Growing population impact
- Resource depletion
- Global warming concerns


Hereâ€™s a more concise guideline for discussing micro and macro ethics in a case study:

### Short Guidelines for Analyzing Micro and Macro Ethics

1. **Understand the Case Context**  
   - Read the case to identify key events, stakeholders, and ethical dilemmas.

2. **Identify Stakeholders**  
   - List relevant parties and their roles, interests, and responsibilities.

3. **Micro Ethical Issues**  
   - **Decision-Making**: Analyze individual or organizational choices and ethical principles involved.
   - **Consequences**: Evaluate the impact of these decisions on stakeholders.
   - **Accountability**: Determine who is responsible for actions and outcomes.

4. **Macro Ethical Issues**  
   - **Societal Impact**: Assess broader societal implications, such as environmental and safety concerns.
   - **Legal Framework**: Consider the adequacy of laws and regulations.
   - **Professional Responsibility**: Reflect on the obligations of engineering societies and organizations.

5. **Interconnection**  
   - Discuss how micro and macro issues influence one another.

6. **Propose Solutions**  
   - Suggest actions to address identified ethical issues and improve outcomes.

7. **Encourage Discussion**  
   - Conclude with open-ended questions to promote dialogue on ethical implications.
