# Engineering tasks and possible outcomes 

| Tasks                  | Common Problems                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Conceptual design      | Patent violations; illegal use cases         |
| Goals & specifications | Unrealistic assumptions; untested materials  |
| Preliminary analysis   | Unbalanced expertise in design               |
| Detailed analysis      | Uncritical use of data and programs          |
| Simulation/prototyping | Incomplete or biased testing                 |
| Design specifications  | Inflexible design; poor change control       |
| Scheduling             | Unrealistic timelines                        |
| Purchasing             | Vendor bias; bribes; poor quality control    |
| Fabrication            | Poor material quality; undetected defects    |
| Assembly/construction  | Poor workplace safety; toxic waste issues    |
| Quality control        | Compromised testing; falsified results       |
| Advertising/sales      | False claims; overselling                    |
| Shipping/installation  | Transport issues; poor supervision           |
| Safety measures        | Complex safety systems; no backup            |
| Use                    | Misuse; overloading; poor documentation      |
| Maintenance/repairs    | Limited spare parts; delayed recalls         |
| Monitoring             | No product lifecycle tracking                |
| Recycling/disposal     | Poor disposal planning; hazard communication |
# Potential Moral problems 


Here's the simplified, more concise version:

1. Tunnel vision and groupthink limiting innovation

2. Technical incompetence of engineers

3. Poor management of time and materials

4. Silo mentality Poor information sharing between departments

5. Over-reliance on safety engineers

6. Product misuse by end users

7. Dishonesty and shortcut-taking under management pressure

8. Lack of post-sale product monitoring
