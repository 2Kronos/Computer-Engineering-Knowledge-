### Summary of Engineering Ethics and Morality

Engineering ethics encompasses the moral responsibilities, rights, and values essential in engineering practice. It has two main aspects:

1. **Normative Ethics**  
   - **Moral Values and Actions**: Focuses on justified moral principles and practices, such as what engineers should do to uphold integrity and ethical standards.
   - **Study of Morality**: Investigates which actions, goals, and policies are morally justified in engineering.

2. **Descriptive Ethics**  
   - Examines how engineers actually think and behave, often studied by social scientists through surveys and behavior analysis without judging if their actions are justified.

Defining morality itself is complex. It includes principles like honesty and justice, but broader definitions often relate to ethical theories. Examples include:
   - **Utilitarianism**: Morality as promoting the most good.
   - **Rights Ethics**: Morality focused on human rights.
   - **Virtue Ethics**: Morality based on good character.

These theories provide a foundation for understanding and studying ethics in engineering.
