## Responsibility for Electrical Installations

1. **General Responsibility**: If you use or lease an electrical installation, you are responsible for its safety, proper use, and maintenance.
2. **Conductors’ Safety**: You are also responsible for the safety of the electrical conductors on your property that connect the installation to the main power supply, especially if the main supply point is not the control point.
3. **Transferred Responsibility**: If there is a written agreement transferring responsibility for the electrical installation to a tenant, the tenant then takes on the same responsibilities as the user or lessor.

## Approval  Inspection Authorities for Electrical Installations

1. **Approval Process**: The chief inspector can approve a person as an inspection authority if they are accredited by the relevant authority.
2. **Application Requirements**: To apply, you need to submit a form (Annexure 2), a certified copy of your accreditation certificate, and the required fee.
3. **Notification of Changes**: If there are any changes affecting your approval, you must inform the chief inspector within 14 days.

## Functions of Approved Inspection Authorities for Electrical Installations

1. **When They Can Inspect**: An approved inspection authority can enter premises to inspect, test, or investigate an electrical installation only if:
    
    - They are hired by the chief inspector or provincial director for a specific job.
    - They are asked by the user or lessor of the electrical installation.
2. **Restriction**: An approved inspection authority cannot work as an electrical contractor.


## Design and construction


1. **Compliance with Standards**: No one can authorize, design, install, or require an electrical installation unless it follows the health and safety standards set by the regulations.
2. **Component Standards**: All components used in an electrical installation must meet the required standards. Proof of compliance must be visible on the components or available from the manufacturer or supplier.
3. **Uncovered Items**: If certain parts of an installation are not covered by the standards, they must be installed according to the supplier’s by-laws or regulations.
4. **Supervision**: A registered person must oversee all electrical installation work. No work can be done without this supervision.
5. **High Voltage Installations**: For installations with voltage over 1 kV, a competent person or a registered professional must approve the design.
6. **Multiple Users**: If a new supply point will serve five or more users, an approved inspection authority or a competent person must ensure compliance from start to finish.
7. **Supplier Restrictions**: Suppliers cannot limit the application of health and safety standards unless it affects their distribution system.

## Electrical contractor


1. **Registration Requirement**: You cannot do electrical installation work as an electrical contractor unless you are registered according to these regulations.
2. **Annual Registration**: Electrical contractors must register every year using the form in Annexure 3 with the chief inspector or their appointee.
3. **Application Fee**: The registration application must include the fee specified in regulation 14.
4. **Registration Process**: The chief inspector or their appointee will register the contractor and add them to the national database if the contractor:
    - Has a fixed address and a telephone.
    - Employs a registered person full-time or is a registered person themselves.

## Certificate of Compliance

1. **Requirement**: Every user or lessor of an electrical installation must have a valid certificate of compliance (CoC) for the installation, along with an approved test report.
2. **Production on Request**: Users or lessors must show the CoC to an inspector, supplier, or approved inspection authority when asked.
3. **Exemptions**: Installations existing before 23 October 1992, with no ownership change after 1 March 1994, are exempt unless modified. If modified, a CoC for the entire installation is required.
4. **Additions or Alterations**: If any changes are made to an installation, a CoC must be obtained for those changes.
5. **Ownership Change**: Ownership cannot change if the CoC is older than two years.
6. **Supplier Inspections**: Suppliers can inspect or test installations at any time without charging a fee unless requested by the user or lessor.
7. **Faults and Defects**: If an inspection finds a fault or defect, a new CoC may be required. If the fault is dangerous, the supply must be disconnected immediately. Any negligence must be reported to the chief inspector.

## Commencement and permission to connect installation work

1. **Notification for New or Increased Supply**: You must notify the supplier using Annexure 4 before starting any installation work that requires a new electricity supply or an increase in supply capacity. The supplier can waive this requirement for certain types of work.
2. **Connection to Supply**: You cannot connect any completed or partially completed electrical installation to the electricity supply until it has been inspected, tested, and a certificate of compliance (CoC) has been issued by a registered person. However, the supplier can connect the supply temporarily for testing and completing the CoC. This rule does not apply if the electricity was disconnected due to non-payment or if there has been a change of tenant but not ownership

## Issuing of certificate of compliance

1. **Issuing Authority**: Only a registered person can issue a certificate of compliance (CoC).
2. **Conditions for Issuing a CoC**: A registered person can issue a CoC with a test report only after inspecting and testing to ensure:
    - A new installation meets regulation 5(1) and was done under their supervision.
    - An existing installation meets general safety principles if it was installed before the current standards.
    - For existing installations with extensions or alterations:
        - The existing part meets general safety principles and is safe.
        - The new work meets regulation 5(1) and was done under their supervision.
3. **Faults and Defects**: If any faults or defects are found before issuing a CoC, the registered person must not issue the CoC until they are fixed. If the fault is dangerous, they must disconnect the supply and notify the chief inspector.
4. **Ensuring Compliance**: Anyone doing electrical installation work must ensure a valid CoC is issued for the work.
5. **No Amendments**: No one can amend a CoC.
