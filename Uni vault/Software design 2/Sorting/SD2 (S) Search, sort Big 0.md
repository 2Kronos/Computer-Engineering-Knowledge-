# Linear search sum

- Comparing the array to the data to the search key

```Simplify
----Method class----
Method to generate random number
Method to search for the data
Methid to print array as a string using toString

----Driver class------
creating the size of the array
code to print out if the intger is found
code to print if the integer is not found
code to quit the seearch (-1)
```

# Binary search 
- Bisecting the array by into 2 parts using the middle value and re initialising the middle value based on the two halves 
```Simplify
----Method class----
Method to generate random number
initialise the low, middel, high and if location is not found
loop to search element
loop to print out the remaining element
Methid to print array as a string using toString

----Driver class------
initialising the search number and posution
creating the size of the array
code to print out if the intger is found
code to print if the integer is not found(user must put a new number to search or quit)
code to quit the seearch (-1)
```

# Selection sort

- Finding the smallest value and swapping out the value so with the first value and then finding the second-smallest value and swapping it out with the second value.

```
-----Method class-----
- Method to generate random numbers
-Method to sort the array by finding the smallest ellement
{swapping method
printPass method}
-Swapping method
-printPass method
-toString method()

----Driver class------

-Pass thr number for the array to be made 
-Print unsorted array
-Call the sortArray method
-Print the sorted array
