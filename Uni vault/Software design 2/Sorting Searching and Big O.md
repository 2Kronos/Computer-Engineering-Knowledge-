* Searching algorithms use either **linear** and **Binary** search
* Sorting algorithms **selection sort, insertion sort, Merge sort**

## Linear Searching 
* Sequential search of a **Search key** in an array of data
	-  Each array element is compared to the **Search key** until it is found or we have reached the end of an array
	- Finding the search key returns the index of  element.
	- If there are **duplicate** values in the array, index of only **first element** is returned
