 On this day this is the final promise as I sit here. Weak alone and afraid in the shadow of the world all alone like a weak abandoned puppy. 

I see them I know how strong they are. I know how big they are I know how small I am I know how insignificant.......... but 

I am willl CRUSH THEM ALL.

I am gonna unseath it now the kaizen blade all the hopes, dreams, faith, aspirations, prayers, believes, motivation, resolve all in one blade that will cut through all challenges like butter.

I AM CHRINOVIC RAYA TSHIWAYA AND I SHALL STEAR MYSELF TO THE TOP
