- Write the binary value into the A inputs
- Get the Decimal value for the selector that decimal value corresponds with the A input that will be chosen to into the data line. The same decimal vlaue will choose where to dispaly the outputs
- Once the output position is chosen set the rest to 0 and get the decimal value
