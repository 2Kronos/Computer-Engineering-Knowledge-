- **RESET (Pin 4)**: This pin is used to reset the timing cycle. It is connected to **VCC** (5V) here, meaning the timer is not being reset, allowing it to operate continuously.

- **DISCH (Pin 7)**: The discharge pin is responsible for discharging the timing capacitor (**CT**, 47nF in this case) to ground when the output is low. This pin is connected to **R1 (7kΩ)** and **R2 (2kΩ)** in the circuit, forming part of the RC charging and discharging network

 <u> Astable Mode Operation</u>

- The circuit is configured in **astable mode**, meaning the 555 timer continuously generates a square wave signal without requiring external triggers.
- **R1, R2**, and **CT (capacitor)** form the timing components that control the frequency and duty cycle of the square wave. The capacitor charges through both **R1** and **R2**, but discharges only through **R2**, influencing the waveform shape and timing.

<u> Waveform on the oscilloscope </u>\

- Channel A shows a square wave that oscillates between high (5V) and low (near 0V), as expected from the astable operation of the 555 timer.
- The waveform frequency and duty cycle are determined by the values of **R1, R2**, and **CT**. The graph shows the periodic nature of the output, with a distinct on and off time as the capacitor charges and discharges.
- On the oscilloscope, **Channel A** is measuring the output signal of the 555 timer, showing a square wave oscillation between 0V and 5V.
- **Channel B** likely represents the capacitor’s charging and discharging voltage, showing a triangular wave. This wave is typical because the capacitor’s voltage gradually rises and falls as it charges and discharges through the resistors.
