### Windows
- **Tools**: Uses ==mutexes==, critical sections, <u>semaphores</u>, and *events for synchronization.*
- **Features**: Priority-based preemptive scheduling; critical sections are faster for synchronizing threads within the same process, while mutexes and semaphores can synchronize across processes.

### Linux
- **Tools**: Uses ==mutexes==, critical sections, <u>semaphores</u>, *events for synchronization.*
- **Tools**: Includes <u>semaphores</u>, spinlocks, , and futexes (fast user-space mutex).
- **Features**: Supports POSIX-style threading with various locking mechanisms; spinlocks are common for kernel-level synchronization, while semaphores and mutexes manage process-level access.

### Solaris
- **Tools**: Uses ==mutexes==, critical sections, <u>semaphores</u>, and *events for synchronization.*
- **Tools**: Provides , condition variables, <u>semaphores</u>, and reader-writer locks.
- **Features**: Priority-based scheduling with multiple synchronization primitives tailored for specific needs; condition variables and reader-writer locks are common for managing access to shared resources.

### Pthreads (POSIX Threads)
- **Tools**: Uses ==mutexes==, critical sections, <u>semaphores</u>, and *events for synchronization.*
- **Tools**: Offers  condition variables, <u>semaphores</u>, and reader-writer locks.
- **Features**: Portable synchronization primitives for multi-threading across different operating systems; mutexes prevent race conditions, and condition variables handle process waiting scenarios.
