### Requirements for Mutual Exclusion
- **Enforcement of Mutual Exclusion**: 
  - Only one process can access its critical section at a time, ensuring no conflicts for shared resources or objects.

- **Non-interference by Halting**: 
  - A process that halts must do so without disrupting the operation of other processes.

- **No Deadlock or Starvation**:
  - A process requesting access to the critical section should not be delayed indefinitely.

- **No Delay When No Process is in Critical Section**:
  - If no process is in a critical section, any process requesting entry must be allowed to enter immediately.


- **Finite Critical Section Time**:
  - A process must stay within its critical section for only a finite period.

### Mutual Exclusion: Hardware Support

- **Interrupt Disabling**:
  - **Uniprocessor System**: Processes cannot execute simultaneously but can be interleaved.
  - **Process Execution**: A process runs until it calls an OS service or is interrupted.
  - **Guaranteeing Mutual Exclusion**: Prevent interruptions to ensure mutual exclusion.
  - **Interrupt Control**: The OS kernel provides primitives to disable and enable interrupts.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Efficiency**: Disabling interrupts can reduce efficiency, as it limits the processor's ability to interleave processes.
  - **Multiprocessor Limitation**: This method does not work in a multiprocessor system, as interrupt disabling only applies to a single processor.

### Mutual Exclusion: Hardware Support

- **Compare&Swap Instruction**:
  - **Description**: Also known as "compare and exchange."
  - **Operation**: Compares a memory value to a test value. If they match, a swap occurs.
  - **Atomicity**: This operation is carried out atomically, meaning it is not subject to interruption.

### Special Machine Instruction

- **Advantages**:
  - **Applicability**: Works for any number of processes on both single-processor and multiprocessor systems sharing main memory.
  - **Simplicity**: The instruction is simple and easy to verify.
  - **Multiple Critical Sections**: Can support multiple critical sections, each defined by its own variable.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Busy-Waiting**: The process continuously consumes processor time while waiting for access to the critical section.
  - **Starvation**: The process selection for the critical section is arbitrary, leading to the potential for indefinite denial of access to some processes.
  - **Deadlock**: Deadlock is possible if processes are waiting for each other in a circular manner.

# Definition

Hereâ€™s a summary of the text you provided:

- **Semaphore**: An integer used for process synchronization. It supports three atomic operations: initialize, decrement, and increment. The decrement operation can block a process, while the increment can unblock it. It is also called a counting semaphore.

- **Binary Semaphore**: A semaphore that only takes the values 0 or 1.

- **Mutex**: Similar to a binary semaphore but with a key difference: the process that locks the mutex (sets it to 0) must be the one to unlock it (set it to 1).

- **Condition Variable**: A data type that blocks a process or thread until a specific condition is true.

 - **Monitor** is a synchronization tool that controls access to shared resources, allowing only one process to use it at a time. It ensures that all processes access shared data safely and may include a queue for processes waiting to use the resource.

- **Event Flags**: A memory word used for synchronization, where each bit corresponds to a different event. A thread waits for specific events by checking one or more bits. It blocks until the required bits are set.

Mailboxes/Messages | A means for two processes to exchange information and that may be used for synchronization.

Spinlocks | Mutual exclusion mechanism in which a process executes in an infinite loop waiting for the value of a lock variable to indicate availability.
