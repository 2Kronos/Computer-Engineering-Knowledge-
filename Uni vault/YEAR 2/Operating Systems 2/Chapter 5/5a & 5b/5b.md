### Implementation Without Busy Waiting

- **Waiting Queue**: Holds processes needing to wait, avoiding constant checks.
  - **block()**: Adds a process to the queue when it cannot proceed.
  - **wakeup()**: Moves a process from the queue to the ready state.
  
This method minimizes busy waiting by using a queue, making semaphore management more efficient.

# Deadlock and starvation

**Deadlock**:

- Occurs when processes wait indefinitely for each other to release resources.
- Example: Process P0 waits on S then Q, while Process P1 waits on Q then S, causing both to be stuck.

- **Starvation**:
	  - A process is blocked indefinitely in the queue and never executes
	  - Remain stuck in sephamore que


**Priority Inversion**:

- A lower-priority process holds a lock needed by a higher-priority process.
- **Solution**: **Priority-inheritance protocol** raises the low-priority processâ€™s priority temporarily.

### Classical Synchronization Problems

Used to test synchronization techniques:

- **Bounded-Buffer**: Controls access to a fixed-size buffer for producers and consumers.
- **Readers and Writers**: Manages shared resource access by readers and writers.
- **Dining Philosophers**: Demonstrates deadlock and resource allocation.
