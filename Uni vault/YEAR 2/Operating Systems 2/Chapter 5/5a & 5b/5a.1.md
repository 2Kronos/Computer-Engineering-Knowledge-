### Process Synchronization

- **Cooperating Process**: A process that can affect or be affected by others.
  - Can share memory directly (e.g., via threads) or use files/messages for communication.
  - Concurrent access to shared data may cause inconsistency, requiring synchronization.

### Producer-Consumer Problem

- **Producer** creates data consumed by **Consumer** (e.g., compiler → assembler → loader).
- Solution uses **shared memory** and a **buffer**.
  - **Unbounded buffer**: No limit on size, producer can always produce.
  - **Bounded buffer**: Fixed size, producer/consumer must wait when buffer is full/empty.
- **Counter variable**: Tracks buffer size (incremented by producer, decremented by consumer).

**Race Condition**: Multiple processes access shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable results. Synchronization is needed.

# Critical Section Problem

- **Critical Section**: Code that manipulates shared data each process has.
  - Only one process can execute in its critical section at a time.
  - Process must request permission to enter it, using the **entry section**.
  - **Exit section** and **remainder section** follow.

## Criteria for Synchronization:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process in critical section at a time.
2. `Progress` - If no process is executing in its critical section and there exist some processes that wish to enter their critical section, then the selection of the processes that will enter the critical section next cannot be postponed indefinitely
   
3. `Bounded Waiting` - A bound must exist on the number of times that other processes are allowed to enter their critical sections after a process has made a request to enter its critical section and before that request is granted 
	
### Handling in OS

- **Preemptive**: Processes can be interrupted and replaced when running in kernal mode.
- Non-preemptive – runs until exits kernel mode, blocks, or voluntarily yields CPU
	- Process completes the its task even if there is an interrupt 
	- Essentially free of race conditions in kernel mode
## Peterson solution
Peterson’s solution is a synchronization algorithm for two processes that prevents them from accessing the critical section simultaneously. It uses two shared variables:

- **flag[ ]**: Each process sets its `flag` to `true` when it wants to enter the critical section.
- **turn**: Indicates whose turn it is to enter if both processes want access.

### How it Works
1. **Process Setup**: Each process sets its `flag` to `true` and gives the other process priority by setting `turn`.
2. **Busy Wait**: The process waits until either the other process’s `flag` is `false` or the `turn` variable favors it.
3. **Critical Section Access**: Only one process can enter at a time, ensuring **mutual exclusion**.
4. **Bounded Waiting and Fairness**: `turn` alternates access, ensuring each process gets a fair chance to enter.

### Key Benefits
Peterson’s solution ensures:
- **Mutual exclusion** (one process at a time in the critical section).
- **Progress** (no indefinite blocking).
- **Bounded waiting** (each process will eventually enter). 

This simple algorithm effectively prevents race conditions.

# Memory 
Memory barriers (or memory fences) enforce the order of memory operations in multi-threaded systems, preventing data inconsistencies due to instruction reordering by CPUs or compilers. 

- **Types**:
  - **Load Barrier**: Prevents reads from being reordered after it.
  - **Store Barrier**: Prevents writes from being reordered after it.
  - **Full Barrier**: Prevents any reordering of reads and writes around it.

- **Purpose**: Used by operating systems in synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks) to ensure consistent data access across threads.

Memory barriers are essential in multi-core systems for reliable, predictable access to shared resources.
