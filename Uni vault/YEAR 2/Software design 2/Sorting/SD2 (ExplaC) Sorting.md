## Explanation of Linear search

* Full code at [[SD2 Sorting Full Code#Linear search]]
```java
public class LinearArray {

private int[] data;

private static final Random generator = new Random();

  

// Constructor to initialize the array with random integers

public LinearArray(int size) {

data = new int[size];

for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {

data[i] = 10 + generator.nextInt(90);

}

}
```
- Linear search of array elements

```java
    // Method to perform a linear search on the array
    public int linearSearch(int searchKey) {
        for (int index = 0; index < data.length; index++) {
            if (data[index] == searchKey) {
                return index; // Return the index if the searchKey is found
            }
        }
        return -1; // Return -1 if the searchKey is not found
    }
```
* This method performs a linear search on the arrayÂ `data`Â to find theÂ `searchKey`.
- It loops through each element of the array.
- If the current element matches theÂ `searchKey`, it returns the index of that element.
- If the loop completes without finding theÂ `searchKey`, it returnsÂ `-1`Â indicating the key was not found
```java
  public static int linearSearch(int[] data, int searchKey) {

// loop through array sequentially

for (int index = 0; index < data.length; index++) {

if (data[index] == searchKey)

return index; // return index of integer

}

return -1; // integer was not found
```

# Binary search explanation

* **Binary search Method explanation** in 
```java
public int binarySearch(int searchElement) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = data.length - 1;
    int middle = (low + high + 1) / 2;
    int location = -1;

    do {
        if (searchElement == data[middle])
            location = middle;
        else if (searchElement < data[middle])
            high = middle - 1;
        else
            low = middle + 1;

        middle = (low + high + 1) / 2;
    } while ((low <= high) && (location == -1));

    return location;
}
```

- `low`Â is the starting index of the array (0).
- `high`Â is the ending index of the array (`data.length - 1`).
- `middle`Â is the midpoint of the current search range.
- `location`Â is initialized toÂ `-1`, indicating that the element has not been found yet.

**LOOP explanation**

- The loop continues as long asÂ `low`Â is less than or equal toÂ `high`Â and theÂ `location`Â isÂ `-1`Â (element not found).
- **Check Middle Element:**Â IfÂ `searchElement`Â is equal toÂ `data[middle]`, the element is found, andÂ `location`Â is set toÂ `middle`.
- **Adjust Search Range:**
    - IfÂ `searchElement`Â is less thanÂ `data[middle]`, it means the element must be in the lower half of the current range, soÂ `high`Â is adjusted toÂ `middle - 1`.
    - IfÂ `searchElement`Â is greater thanÂ `data[middle]`, it means the element must be in the upper half of the current range, soÂ `low`Â is adjusted toÂ `middle + 1`.
- **Recalculate Middle:**Â TheÂ `middle`Â index is recalculated based on the newÂ `low`Â andÂ `high`Â values.
-  After the loop ends, the method returns theÂ `location`Â of theÂ `searchElement`. If the element was not found,Â `location`Â remainsÂ `-1`.
## Remaining elements Method

```java
public String remainingElements(int low, int high) {
    StringBuilder temporary = new StringBuilder();

    // output spaces for alignment
    for (int i = 0; i < low; i++)
        temporary.append(" ");

    // output elements left in array
    for (int i = low; i <= high; i++)
        temporary.append(data[i] + " ");

    temporary.append("\n");
    return temporary.toString();
}

```
- This method is designed to output a subset of the array elements as a string. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Parameters**: It takes two parameters,Â `low`Â andÂ `high`, which define the range of indices in the array to be included in the output.
2. **StringBuilder**: It uses aÂ `StringBuilder`Â object namedÂ `temporary`Â to build the output string efficiently.
3. **Alignment Spaces**: It first appends spaces to theÂ `temporary`Â object for alignment purposes, based on theÂ `low`Â index.
4. **Appending Elements**: It then appends the elements from theÂ `low`Â index to theÂ `high`Â index, separated by spaces.
5. **New Line**: Finally, it appends a newline character and returns the resulting string.
   
## Explanation of sting builder in this code
The `StringBuilder` class in Java is used to create mutable (modifiable) strings. In the context of the `remainingElements` method, `StringBuilder` serves several important purposes:

### Efficiency

- **Performance**: `StringBuilder` is more efficient than using regular string concatenation (`+` operator) in a loop. This is because strings in Java are immutable, meaning each concatenation creates a new string object, which can be slow and memory-intensive. `StringBuilder` avoids this by modifying the same object.

### Building the Output String

- **Appending Data**: The `StringBuilder` allows the method to append spaces and array elements efficiently. This is crucial for creating the formatted string that represents the current segment of the array being considered in the binary search.
- **Flexibility**: It provides methods like `append` to easily add different types of data (e.g., strings, integers) to the builder.

### Example in Context

Hereâ€™s how `StringBuilder` is used in the `remainingElements` method:

```java
public String remainingElements(int low, int high) {
    StringBuilder temporary = new StringBuilder();

    // output spaces for alignment
    for (int i = 0; i < low; i++)
        temporary.append(" ");

    // output elements left in array
    for (int i = low; i <= high; i++)
        temporary.append(data[i] + " ");

    temporary.append("\n");

    return temporary.toString();
}
```

- **Initialization**: `StringBuilder temporary = new StringBuilder();` initializes a new `StringBuilder` instance.
- **Appending Spaces**: `temporary.append(" ");` adds spaces for alignment.
- **Appending Elements**: `temporary.append(data[i] + " ");` adds the array elements followed by a space.
- **Appending New Line**: `temporary.append("\n");` adds a newline character at the end.

### Final Output

- **Conversion to String**: `return temporary.toString();` converts the `StringBuilder` content to a `String` and returns it.

Using `StringBuilder` ensures that the method is both efficient and easy to read, making it a good choice for building complex strings in Java.

## To String Method

```java
public String toString() {
    return remainingElements(0, data.length - 1);
}
```

TheÂ `toString`Â method is a standard method in Java that returns a string representation of an object. In this class, it overrides the defaultÂ `toString`Â method to provide a custom string representation of theÂ `BinaryArray`Â object.

1. **CallingÂ `remainingElements`**: It calls theÂ `remainingElements`Â method withÂ `0`Â andÂ `data.length - 1`Â as arguments, which means it outputs all elements in the array.
2. **Return Value**: It returns the string produced by theÂ `remainingElements`Â method.

# Explanation of Slection Sorting code 

## Selection sort code anlysis 

Full code at [[SD2 Sorting Full Code#Full Selection sort]]
Walk through is at 

- This class has two private instance variables  an array of ints named data, and a static Random object to generate random integers to fill the array.
**Sort Method** 
Walk through is at [[SD2 (ExapleW) Sorting#Sort method]]
```java
public void sort() {
    int smallest;//will hold smallest element in array
    for (int i = 0; i < data.length - 1; i++) {
        smallest = i;
        for (int index = i + 1; index < data.length; index++)
            if (data[index] < data[smallest])
                smallest = index;
        swap(i, smallest);
        printPass(i + 1, smallest);
    }
}
```

1. **Outer loop**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < data.length - 1; i++) {
    smallest = i;
```
- The outer loop runs from the first element to the second-to-last element of the array.
- `i`Â represents the current position in the array where the smallest element will be placed.
- Initially,Â `smallest`Â is set toÂ `i`, assuming the first element of the unsorted portion is the smallest.
  
2. **Inner loop**
```java
for (int index = i + 1; index < data.length; index++) {
    if (data[index] < data[smallest])
        smallest = index;
}
```
- The inner loop runs from the element right afterÂ `i`Â to the last element of the array.
- It compares each element in the unsorted portion with the current smallest element.
- If a smaller element is found,Â `smallest`Â is updated to the index of this new smallest element
- 1. - This loop starts atÂ `i + 1`Â and goes to the end of the array. The reason it starts atÂ `i + 1`Â is because the element at indexÂ `i`Â is already considered as the current smallest element in the unsorted portion. The inner loop is responsible for finding the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array.

1. **Swapping element** 
```java
printPass(i + 1, smallest);
```
 - After the inner loop completes, the smallest element in the unsorted portion is swapped with the element at indexÂ `i`.
    - This places the smallest element in its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.
4. **Printing pass**
```java
printPass(i + 1, smallest);
```

* - TheÂ `printPass`Â method is called to print the state of the array after each pass of the outer loop.
- This helps in visualizing the sorting process step by step.


**Swap Method**
Example walk through at [[SD2 (ExapleW) Sorting#Swap Method]]
```java
public void swap(int first, int second) {
    int temporary = data[first]; // store first in temporary
    data[first] = data[second]; // replace first with second
    data[second] = temporary; // put temporary in second
}
```
 * It is void so it has no return type
 1. Sorting the first Element
```java
int temporary = data[first];
```
- - A temporary variableÂ `temporary`Â is created to hold the value of the element at indexÂ `first`.
2. Replacing the first element
```java
data[first] = data[second];
```
- he value of the element at indexÂ `second`Â is assigned to the element at indexÂ `first`.
- This effectively moves the value of the second element to the position of the first element.
3. Putting the temporary Values in the Second Element
```java
data[second] = temporary;
```

- The value stored in theÂ `temporary`Â variable (originally the value of the first element) is assigned to the element at indexÂ `second`.
- This completes the swap, as the original value of the first element is now in the position of the second element.

**PrintPass Method**
walk through at [[SD2 (ExapleW) Sorting#Walk through Printpass Method]]
```java
public void printPass(int pass, int index) {
    System.out.print(String.format("after pass %2d:", pass));

    // output elements till selected item
    for (int i = 0; i < index; i++)
        System.out.print(data[i] + " ");

    System.out.print(data[index] + "* "); // indicate swap

    // finish outputting array
    for (int i = index + 1; i < data.length; i++)
        System.out.print(data[i] + " ");

    System.out.print("\n "); // for alignment

    // indicate amount of array that is sorted
    for (int j = 0; j < pass; j++)
        System.out.print("-- ");
    System.out.println("\n"); // add end line
}

```
1. Method Signature
```java
public void printPass(int pass, int index)
```
- It takes two parameters:Â `pass`Â (the current pass number) andÂ `index`Â (the index of the element that was swapped).
- - The method isÂ `public`, meaning it can be called from outside the class.

1. **Printing the Pass Number**

```java
System.out.print(String.format("after pass %2d:", pass));
```
* This line prints the pass number in a formatted string.
- `%2d`Â ensures the pass number is printed with a width of 2 characters, aligning the output nicely.
3. **Printing Elements Before the Swapped Element**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < index; i++)
    System.out.print(data[i] + " ");
```
- This loop prints all elements in the array up to (but not including) the element atÂ `index`.
- Each element is followed by a space for readability.
4. **Indicating the Swapped Element:**
    ```java
System.out.print(data[index] + "* ");
    ```
-  This prints the element atÂ `index`Â followed by an asterisk (`*`), indicating that this element was involved in the swap.
5. **Priniting the Elements After the Swappped Element**
```java
for (int i = index + 1; i < data.length; i++)
    System.out.print(data[i] + " ");
```
*  This loop prints all elements in the array after the element atÂ `index`.
- Each element is followed by a space for readability.
6. **Alignment and Sorted Portion Indication**:
    
    Java
    
    ```java
    System.out.print("\n "); // for alignment
    
    for (int j = 0; j < pass; j++)
        System.out.print("-- ");
    System.out.println("\n"); // add end line
    ```
    
    - The firstÂ `System.out.print("\n ");`Â adds a newline and a space for alignment.
    - The second loop prints dashes (`--`) to indicate the portion of the array that is sorted after each pass.
    - `System.out.println("\n");`Â adds another newline for better readability.

Sure! The loop that indicates the sorted portion of the array is found towards the end of the `printPass` method. This loop prints dashes (`--`) to visually represent the part of the array that has been sorted after each pass of the selection sort algorithm.

### Code Segment

```java
public void printPass(int pass, int index) {
    // ... (previous code for printing the array)

    System.out.print("\n "); // for alignment

    // indicate amount of array that is sorted
    for (int j = 0; j < pass; j++)
        System.out.print("-- ");
    System.out.println("\n"); // add end line
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Alignment**:
    
    - `System.out.print("\n ");`
    - This line adds a newline character and a space for alignment purposes, ensuring that the dashes are printed on a new line below the array elements.
2. **Indicating Sorted Portion**:
    
    - `for (int j = 0; j < pass; j++)` `System.out.print("-- ");`
    - This loop iterates from `0` to `pass - 1`, where `pass` is the current pass number of the sorting algorithm. For each iteration, it prints a dash (`--`), followed by a space.
    - The number of dashes printed corresponds to the number of elements that have been sorted so far. For example, after the first pass, one element is sorted, so one dash is printed. After the second pass, two elements are sorted, so two dashes are printed, and so on.
3. **End Line**:
    
    - `System.out.println("\n");`
    - This line adds another newline character to separate the output of each pass, making the output more readable.

### Visual Example

Letâ€™s say the array is `[15, 35, 20, 40, 50]` after the first pass. The `printPass` method would output something like this:

```
after pass  1: 15* 35 20 40 50 
 -- 
```

After the second pass, the output might look like this:

```
after pass  2: 15 20* 35 40 50 
 -- -- 
```

### Purpose

The purpose of this loop is to provide a visual indication of how much of the array has been sorted after each pass. This helps in understanding the progress of the selection sort algorithm and makes it easier to see which parts of the array are already sorted.

# Insertion sort Explanation

Absolutely, letâ€™s dive deeper into the insertion sort method.

### Insertion Sort Method Breakdown

The `sort` method in the `InsertionSort` class implements the insertion sort algorithm. Hereâ€™s the method again for reference:

```java
public void sort() {
    int insert; // temporary variable to hold element to insert
    // loop over data.length - 1 elements
    for (int next = 1; next < data.length; next++) {
        // store value in current element
        insert = data[next];
        // initialize location to place element
        int moveItem = next;
        // search for place to put current element
        while (moveItem > 0 && data[moveItem - 1] > insert) {
            // shift element right one slot
            data[moveItem] = data[moveItem - 1];
            moveItem--;
        } // end while
        data[moveItem] = insert; // place inserted element
        printPass(next, moveItem); // output pass of algorithm
    } // end for
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
    
    ```java
    int insert;
    ```
    
    - A temporary variable `insert` is declared to hold the value of the element that needs to be inserted into its correct position.
2. **Outer Loop**:
    
    ```java
    for (int next = 1; next < data.length; next++) {
    ```
    
    - The loop starts from the second element (`next = 1`) and iterates through the array. The first element is considered sorted by itself.
3. **Storing the Current Element**:
    
    ```java
    insert = data[next];
    ```
    
    - The value of the current element (`data[next]`) is stored in the `insert` variable.
4. **Initialize Position**:
    
    ```java
    int moveItem = next;
    ```
    
    - `moveItem` is initialized to the current index (`next`). This variable will be used to find the correct position for `insert`.
5. **Inner Loop**:
    
    ```java
    while (moveItem > 0 && data[moveItem - 1] > insert) {
        // shift element right one slot
        data[moveItem] = data[moveItem - 1];
        moveItem--;
    }
    ```
    
    - The inner loop searches for the correct position to insert the current element (`insert`).
    - **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `moveItem` is greater than 0 and the element at `data[moveItem - 1]` is greater than `insert`.
    - **Shifting Elements**: If the condition is true, the element at `data[moveItem - 1]` is shifted one position to the right (`data[moveItem] = data[moveItem - 1]`), and `moveItem` is decremented (`moveItem--`).
6. **Insert Element**:
    
    ```java
    data[moveItem] = insert;
    ```
    
    - Once the correct position is found (when the inner loop condition is false), `insert` is placed at `data[moveItem]`.
7. **Print Pass**:
    
    ```java
    printPass(next, moveItem);
    ```
    
    - The `printPass` method is called to display the array after each pass of the insertion sort, showing the progress of the sorting process.

### Example Walkthrough

Letâ€™s go through an example with a small array: `[34, 8, 64, 51, 32, 21]`.

1. **First Pass (`next = 1`)**:
    
    - `insert = 8`
    - `moveItem = 1`
    - Compare `8` with `34` (element at `moveItem - 1`):
        - `34 > 8`, so shift `34` to the right.
        - `moveItem` becomes 0.
    - Insert `8` at position 0.
    - Array after first pass: `[8, 34, 64, 51, 32, 21]`.
2. **Second Pass (`next = 2`)**:
    
    - `insert = 64`
    - `moveItem = 2`
    - Compare `64` with `34`:
        - `34 < 64`, so no shifting needed.
    - Insert `64` at position 2.
    - Array after second pass: `[8, 34, 64, 51, 32, 21]`.
3. **Third Pass (`next = 3`)**:
    
    - `insert = 51`
    - `moveItem = 3`
    - Compare `51` with `64`:
        - `64 > 51`, so shift `64` to the right.
        - `moveItem` becomes 2.
    - Compare `51` with `34`:
        - `34 < 51`, so no more shifting needed.
    - Insert `51` at position 2.
    - Array after third pass: `[8, 34, 51, 64, 32, 21]`.

And so on, until the entire array is sorted.

### Summary

- **Outer Loop**: Iterates through each element starting from the second one.
- **Inner Loop**: Finds the correct position for the current element by shifting larger elements to the right.
- **Insertion**: Places the current element in its correct position.
- **Visualization**: The `printPass` method helps visualize the sorting process after each pass.
