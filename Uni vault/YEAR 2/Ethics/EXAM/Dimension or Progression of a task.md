    - Schedule order of tasks
    - purchase compentents -> schedule order of tasks || simulate prototyping
    - fabricate compents -> schedule order of tasks
    - assemble
    - quality control test -> fabricate components
- Implementation
    
    - Advertise, sales, finance
    - User documentaiton
    - Shipping and installations
        
    - Use the product
