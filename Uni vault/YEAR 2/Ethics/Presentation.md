[Electrocuted teacher loses R35m damages lawsuit | The Citizen](https://www.citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/electrocuted-teacher-loses-r35m-damages-lawsuit/)

# Penalties 

My name is Chrinovic, and I shall continue this presentation by discussing the penalties for not complying with Electrical Installation regulation.

Non-compliance can lead to significant penalties, including fines of up to R1 million, 

imprisonment  up to 12 months or up to 2 years for serious breaches, 

And immediate disconnection of any dangerous installations, 

# Case 1
`A real life case where this regulation was not adhered to
is where

Is the case where retired Mpumalanga teacher, Leaders Mogane, sustained serious burns to his throat, torso and pelvis.

 This was after being electrocuted by a live wire at Bourkeâ€™s Luck Dog School in 2011. Mogane claimed the wire had been dangling for months and nothing was done to repair it.
## Violation

The rules under this regulation that were violated included the Responsibility for Installations rule

as the department owning the property failed to ensure safety and maintenance with a wire dangling for months. 

The Inspection and Testing rule was also not adhered to as the prolonged presence of the wire indicated a lack of proper inspection and maintenance. 

## Prevention measures
The prevention measures that should be placed to ensure something of this magnitude does not happen again are regular inspections to conduct routine checks and repairs, 

Clear warnings signs and barriers should be placed to mark hazards areas

`I will now pass it on to my collegue who shall discuss another real life case.
