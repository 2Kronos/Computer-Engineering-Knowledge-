The image you've shared appears to show a pinout diagram of the **74HC163D** integrated circuit, which is a 4-bit synchronous binary counter, not the **74HC194N** shift register. 

However, based on the **74HC194** 4-bit bidirectional universal shift register, here is an explanation of the typical inputs:

### Inputs for the **74HC194N** Shift Register:
1. **Data Inputs (A, B, C, D)**:
   - These are parallel data inputs used to load a 4-bit word into the shift register when parallel loading is enabled.

2. **Clock (CLK)**:
   - The clock input controls when the data is shifted. On every rising edge (positive edge) of the clock signal, the register will shift or load data depending on the mode of operation.

3. **Shift/Load Control (S0, S1)**:
   - These two control inputs determine the mode of operation:
     - **00**: Hold (no shift).
     - **01**: Shift Right (data shifts from left to right).
     - **10**: Shift Left (data shifts from right to left).
     - **11**: Parallel Load (load data from A, B, C, D inputs into the register).

4. **Serial Data Input (SRI and SLI)**:
   - These are the serial data inputs for right-shift and left-shift operations, respectively.
     - **SRI**: Data to be shifted in from the right when in right-shift mode.
     - **SLI**: Data to be shifted in from the left when in left-shift mode.

5. **Clear (~CLR)**:
   - An asynchronous clear input that, when active (usually low), clears all the flip-flops and sets the register to zero.

6. **Enable (G)**:
   - This input controls whether the shift register is enabled. If it's low, the register will be disabled, and no shifting or loading will occur.

### Outputs:
- **Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3**: These are the 4-bit outputs of the shift register, showing the current state of the register.

The **74HC163D** in the image is a **4-bit synchronous binary counter**. It counts binary numbers from 0 to 15 based on the clock signal and can be controlled by additional inputs for different operations like resetting and loading data. Here's a breakdown of the important pins and how to use them:

### **Inputs of the 74HC163D Counter**:

1. **A, B, C, D (Pins 3, 4, 5, 6)**:
   - These are the parallel data inputs used to load a specific 4-bit value into the counter. The values of A, B, C, and D represent a binary number that can be loaded into the counter when the **LOAD** signal is activated.

2. **Clock (CLK - Pin 2)**:
   - This is the clock input, and the counter increments its count on the rising edge (low to high transition) of the clock. Every time the clock pulses, the counter will increase its count unless other control inputs are active.

3. **Load (~LOAD - Pin 9)**:
   - The **LOAD** input is used to load a specific 4-bit value (A, B, C, D) into the counter. The "~" symbol indicates it is active **low**, meaning that when the signal is **low** (0), the value on A, B, C, and D will be loaded into the counter instead of continuing to count normally. When LOAD is high (1), the counter will operate in its counting mode.

4. **Clear (~CLR - Pin 1)**:
   - The **CLEAR** input is also active **low**. When this input is **low** (0), it resets the counter to 0. When the signal is **high** (1), the counter will not be reset and will continue to count or load values based on the clock signal.

5. **Enable P (ENP - Pin 7) and Enable T (ENT - Pin 10)**:
   - These two enable pins control whether the counter is allowed to count.
     - **ENP** (Enable Parallel): If ENP is **high** (1), the counter will be enabled to operate normally.
     - **ENT** (Enable Terminal): ENT must also be **high** (1) for the counter to count. If either ENP or ENT is low, the counter will be disabled and will not count.
   
   Together, **both ENP and ENT need to be high** for the counter to count. Otherwise, the counter will hold its current value.

6. **Ripple Carry Output (RCO - Pin 15)**:
   - **RCO** is an output pin that goes **high** (1) when the counter reaches its maximum count (15 for a 4-bit counter). This pin is often used to cascade multiple counters together.

### **Outputs (QA, QB, QC, QD - Pins 14, 13, 12, 11)**:
   - These are the 4-bit outputs of the counter. They represent the binary count value of the counter, with **QA** being the least significant bit (LSB) and **QD** being the most significant bit (MSB).

### **Using the Pins**:
1. To **load a specific value** into the counter:
   - Set **~LOAD** (Pin 9) low (0), and apply the desired binary value on the **A, B, C, D** inputs (Pins 3, 4, 5, 6). Once the value is loaded, you can return ~LOAD to high (1) to resume counting.

2. To **reset** the counter:
   - Set **~CLR** (Pin 1) low (0). This will reset the count to 0. When ~CLR goes high (1), the counter will resume its normal operation.

3. To **enable counting**:
   - Ensure both **ENP** (Pin 7) and **ENT** (Pin 10) are high (1). When both are high, the counter will count on every rising edge of the clock (Pin 2).

4. To **cascade** counters:
   - Use the **RCO** (Pin 15) to connect to the enable inputs of another counter if you want to extend the counting range beyond 4 bits.

### Example of Use:
- Set up a clock signal on **CLK (Pin 2)**.
- Apply the initial 4-bit value on **A, B, C, D (Pins 3, 4, 5, 6)**.
- Set **~LOAD** (Pin 9) low (0) to load this value into the counter.
- Set **~LOAD** high (1) to start counting.
- Ensure both **ENP (Pin 7)** and **ENT (Pin 10)** are high (1) to allow counting.
- Monitor the count output on **QA, QB, QC, QD (Pins 14, 13, 12, 11)**.
