# Computer Engineering Knowledge Repository

## Overview
This repository serves as a structured compilation of knowledge, resources, and materials gathered throughout my studies in Computer Engineering. It is managed using Obsidian and contains extensive documentation on topics covered in both my second- and third-year modules. The contents are derived from a combination of university-prescribed materials, academic textbooks, artificial intelligence resources, and supplementary online platforms such as YouTube.
